@anmzn.,"so if you want to record in 120fps, you shouldn’t get 128gb? what if you store your videos on icloud and not native to the device?"
@Zini98,Can’t wait for battery comparison! Going to buy pro only if it’s actually better
@nuskeyajaz1778,Apple’s innovation died with steve jobs 😢

@cactuscat3101,"Compare this review to Linus&#39;s review of the iPhone. MWTB is always an unbiased personal view, what reviews should be. <br>Linus&#39;s on the other hand is clearly paid for and sponsored by Apple."
@Mallwalker1,"It’s a very cheeky thing, that Apple Intelligence will come to Germany not before 2026, are they kidding? It seems Germany doesn’t brings enough money for Apple anymore. The Innovations getting worse, Apple is running behind more and more, celebrating things which other company’s got since years. But more and more high pricy, bringing out little new stuff every year. AirPods Max didn’t even get the new H2 chip, just USB-C port and new colors - really? The new iPad is way too expensive - including the Magic Keyboard. Still waiting for better software, to make the action button more worthy, or to customize the torch and camera button at the screen. I think it would be good, if one year the most people should just not buy any Apple device. It would change the game, but unfortunately it won’t happen."

@faizshaari5702,&quot;Here&#39;s what I found on the web&quot; So true!🤣🤣🤣
@Alfadrottning86,"Considering i am not a fan of iphones, i have to admit that the bezels look thin ... but &quot;the thinnest&quot;? Probably &quot;the thinnest EVEN bezels&quot; .. but then we are in the realm of compromise already. It certainly has not the best screen to body ratio (thanks to the enormous pill shaped cutout that Apple simply does not manage to get rid of). As for bezels .. it feels like even the (how long is it?..) 5 years old (?) Huawei Mate 40 pro/+ might beat the bezel sizes .. but not in terms of even bezels. The current Galaxy s24 Ultra has what looks like 1mm even bezels all around the screen - and the iPhone does look a tiny little bit thinner (in the video).<br><br>All of that is irrelevant once you put a case on it of course - as 99% of the people will do. <br><br>so my own conclusion is:<br>- a new colour (meaningless, as you can skin it or have it in a case anyway .. so it will only carry the new colour &quot;on the inside&quot;)<br>- pointless shutter button that most phones gave up 10 years ago - because its a phone, not a DSLR .. and you (as in the normal user) is not a professional photographer, but just taking snaps that no one cares for<br>- stereoscopic pictures for literally no reason. (also given up by the handful of &quot;3d&quot; phones years ago) - ... and until Apple actually cares for the Vision Pro, that one is just stupid. (and i daresay, Apple simply cannot catch up with the Quest due to ... oh, the dreaded term &quot;ecosystem&quot;) - designwise .. it takes you back to the iPhone X .. a REAL design shift to a remarkable and iconic design language (at that time)<br>- very NICE screens ... maybe noticable? but only on the &quot;naked&quot; phone<br>- very DISAPPOINTING 60hz screens at the same time on the mainstream versions .. really? 60hz? .. feels more like a scam nowadays<br>- 50% better screen protection? simply .. no. That is a lie. It cannot be 50% more scratch resistant or shatter resistant, because that would move the hardness to Sapphire levels or above. So i call that a shady Apple statistics move (and Apple is kind of notorious for &quot;playing&quot; around with graphs and statistics) - i am sure it is 50% &quot;something&quot; .. but not more resistant."

They can add all the health features they want and brag about how bleeding edge their new sound driver is but they are still waay behind on audio resolution. 16 bit 44khz in 2024 is wild and they just get smoked by competition for way cheaper too (some at 24bit192khz). paying 320$ for &quot;&quot;pro&quot;&quot; headphones or even the joke that are the 550$ air pods max I at least expect to have lossless supported in some way but I guess they&#39;re still stuck in 2016. If they can make it work for apple vision pro, they can can make it work for iphones. And yeah I get that it&#39;s not &quot;life changing&quot; for most users and most people won&#39;t even notice. But that&#39;s what the base air pods are for. Wont buy airpods until they fix this, make it lossless. I don&#39;t care."

@sia_josephine,“300 million iPhones haven’t upgraded in at least four years.” Ummm yep and that’s why I’m here. My 4 year old iPhone 12 Pro that I’m completely fine with is apparently not going to be completely supported anymore and I’m going to have to get a new phone. 😒 Both of my parents and my phone have done the “no SIM card” thing and they said we are probably going to continue to have problems. Would be cool if we could just keep using our technology we are happy with.
@-TheRealThing-,"Yeah alright calm down, it&#39;s 86.8% screen-to-body ratio.. Most Honor phones are over 90% so the iphone is FAR from the slimmest bezels on the market. Even the Honor 90 which is mid range is 90.8% screen-to-body-ratio. The high end Honor Magic 6 Pro is 91.6% screen-to-body ratio."
@schmaltzz,"I feel like they could have easily added touch id inside the camera control module. Many people have asked to have a choice of which one to use, and they really missed out on the opportunity to add it here. In many people&#39;s work (like as a doctor or even a mechanic), you need to wear face coverings (like a mask or welding helmet), and it would be must easier to just press a button the side of the phone where your hand is already comfortably positioned to unlock your phone instead of relying on face id only."

@Freddy_Fazbearrrrrr,Apple actually sucks though they do something cool then it just feels like last years phone but with 2 or 3 more features where samsung actually gives you a WHOLE different phone
@Ashitaka2024,Apple: iPhone 16 with a 60Hz display and a new button in 2024…<br>Huawei: Hold my beer.. 🍺
@ankitbera943,Guys a quick question! Should I upgrade to 16 pro max if I have Iphone 15 pro max?
@Emerson-gr8uc,Apple is just overpriced for very fee new features.
@tamzidtaeef9091,Apple: changes color<br>INNOVATION!!!!!
@oladipodiekololaoluwa8680,They finally changed the camera design
@ostorojno1,Anyone else notice how he filmed MKBHD in the distance at the Apple Event?! Nice touch 😜👏
@droplet5507,As a photographer I’m obviously absolutely thrilled about the camera features especially with video making my phone higher quality for weddings!<br>I can understand these features being a bit much for just the standard person but despite that I feel like family oriented people can make their memories more clearly and so beautifully
@melesgouge7377,"Getting the IPhone 16 Pro because I really like the three cameras. I had the 13 pro max for a 4 years and I felt like it was time to update. Plus, I feel like the 6.7 screen is too big for my hand, so the iPhone 16 Pro would be my go to."
@1eyedwilli3,This lineup is making me upgrade my 14PM to a Pixel Pro 9 fold. <br><br><br>THANKS APPLE HAHAHAHAHH
@CadZz04,"If the iPhone 16 had gotten the old Pro chip, it would also have USB 3.0 with a fast data rate, but the &quot;new&quot; A16 chip still only has 2.0 slow transfer"
@Completelygenericnickname,"I got iphone 15 pro half a year ago, sold it 2 months later. Mistake I will not make again. Apple is way overrated, androids are a lot better🤷"
@clarix164,"Im a big apple fan but Im saying for the first time, they have less inovations"
@oguntoyephilip9269,Pls do a test and review on the huawei mate xt pls 😢😢😊😊
@davisesturban4142,apple beat him in subs again 😭
@Sugar199,Apple ai ❌ copycap Samsung ai✅
@Sugar199,"Bro apple ai literary copycap Samsung. Bro, I swear Apple doing shit Samsung has that like a year ago like the hell the circle to search that crazy that apple had to use Google"
@justbeyouhistories,"Now let&#39;s be fr the only thing new it&#39;s the Apple Intelligence and the random camera button, and It&#39;s very unfair that they only made available the Apple intelligence for the 16s and not the previous ones for the next iOS update. This is basically their marketing strategy for get people to buy their phones because they are running out of more ideas."
@BigDon_707,"Phones have maxed out. I still have a iPhone 13 Pro Max and doing just fine. Just update and save you $1,700.00-$2,000.00"
@woke_winston,iPhone 15s
@levi8781,Seems my IPHONE 14 PRO will do just fine lol same thing diff year
@edwardgrafton4663,Hey Arun great video as always with Google bringing out new phones such as the Google Pixel 9 the Google Pixel 9 Pro and the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and now Apple have brought out new phones as well the iPhone 16 the iPhone 16 Plus the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max out off all them new phones which one off them would you change too from your own phone that you use now?
@channingboy6456,"What’s really annoying is people complaining about Apple not adding stuff, then they do it and still complain. Apple adds AI? People still complain! Apple changes design up a little bit? People still complain! You guys ask and you guys get. Let them do there things and stop complaining!"
@hedikaseven,"Im not that great with detailed info on phones but as someone who’s using an iPhone 13 mini I was waiting on the 16 to be a good upgrade which in all honesty it is a decent upgrade but I feel like for the price point ( as a student ) vs what I’ll be getting on the 16 isn’t worth it personally. It has better specs, better quality, better bezels ect all that but on a day to day basis it’s not going to significantly change with the way I view it in terms of usage. Sure, maybe the action button is going to be different and I’ll get faster reaction times to things such as opening apps ect but is that really worth the 1k? For some people yes, me no. I feel like Apple always comes out with the typical ‘ better chip, higher quality, better bezels’ every year and this year AI was introduced and the side action button being used as a manual camera focus but these things feel quiet plain when I think about it because of google pixel, Samsung and other phones coming out with AI before Apple so it feels old even though it’s a complete new feature. Sigh we wait again another year 🥲"
@cosmic.k1d,"Hello Arun, this is that guy that goes, &quot;day 1 of asking Arun for a Google Pixel&quot; well my google pixel 5 literally stopped working 😭, I&#39;m using my old samsung A5, i don&#39;t have any money to fix it, i evenbdid research on the problem and i probablu have to get a new phone,😭 I don&#39;t even knowbif yoid see this comment, well it&#39;s one thing to see and anotouher to actually hope for the best, i hope this message gets to you i dont care if people call me names for having the courage to ask for this from you, 😭😭 I really hope you see it 😭"
@ousmannour6153,where&#39;s your last studio
@myric.k_,keeping my 15 Pro Max not enough upgrades seem like the same phone with minimal things added in need a camera redesign and smaller/ no notch then it would be worth it!
@christianrudolfcadag5896,New camera button is the same as touch pad in iphone 8 with same haptic function. I will not be surprised if apple decide to take back touch ID.
@allinONE-df1xf,Phone rule : &quot;6.9 inch below&quot;<br>Tablet rule : &quot;7.0 inch above&quot;

@Youdonthave2konw123,so what happens to that touch screen camera button when you put on a case?
@Luisjoseglobal,iPhone 11 6th generation
@OFFtheCHIZANE,I would be far more excited by being able to shoot 1000fps at 720p than 4K120.
@jamaldelera9016,The whole advertisement of the iPhone 16 surround the action button and the sad part people will buy it anyway 😢

@xItsKatieMichelle,"for the most part you only talked about the camera features the iphone 16 is terrible, fair enough if you’re a photographer or like taking photos but that phone ain’t for me 😂"
@usmanyaseen9250,oh yaaaaaaay they added a camera button 😮🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
@Liamd330,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=662"">11:02</a> They look exactly the same to me lol"
@9ja_foodieboy,Wait 4 samsung
@derrickbarnes8122,I don&#39;t understand why they don&#39;t add a square sensor that can shoot horizontal video while holding the phone vertically. Then we could change the aspect ratio&#39;s afterward.  They could also add horizontal lock too....That would be worth upgrading to!
@misaelg7153,It’s as if apple want to convence me to look forward for another company…
@MickerManGaming,I’m officially bored of Apple products.

@wilkoweekly7002,Long story short………… let’s see what apple bring out next year
@KingUppal-h2c,I just want it to play fortnite at 120 fps
@Bebb98,60hz on the 13 felt old. How are the standard iPhones not coming with at least a 90hz panel. It&#39;s honestly so disappointing to see that apple is still limiting their customers to this. Like this year&#39;s standard phones haven&#39;t got any features that make them seem worth buying. Surely this could have been the year. Cost to benefits on them just ain&#39;t it.
@Oyinmiebi-o9n,I just spotted Marques Brownlee in your video😂
@adamlaski9128,"Still rocking an 11 Pro. Other than the battery, it’s fine. I’ll likely get the battery replaced when needed which is soonish. I probably won’t be getting a new one for at least 2 years unless needed."

@galaxyphoenix18,"Apple Intelligence wird in EU erst nächstes Jahr kommen, traurig 😢"
@hallowseeve,"I have the iphone 15 standard as a company phone, no action button but I have all the features built in to tapping the backside of my phone(Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Touch &gt; Back Tap).. Currently using double tap as flashlight for when the kids wake up at night where I always struggle to actually turn the flashlight on, it always opens the light intensity setting or simply vibrates without doing anything, I&#39;ve had it set as camera which worked great for quick shots :)<br>Can&#39;t Android simply out-date Apple by launching a phone with a True &quot;action button&quot; that doesn&#39;t have quirks bound to it but simply: &#39;.\&#39; those who know know.."
@Alex-hv3ir,"Tbh, they added so much stuff that it feels very confusing to me. As many have said: 2 new buttons with many overlapping features, the camera button is very confusing, long press, double press, hard press, prolonged hard press…. The camera upgrades, while good are, as Arun said here, very much “pro” oriented…<br><br>The new AirPods 4, the same name but one is 50€ pricier and comes with ANC (but so does the AirPods Pro, what changes then?).<br><br>AirPods Max are still 550€ which is horrendous.<br><br>The new Apple Watches are just huge and SLIGHTLY thinner (instead of the total overhaul that we aspected from the “Apple Watch X”.<br><br>The Apple intelligence stuff that <br> will eventually come out is certainly cool but is it actually useful? the clean up feature from what i&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s OK.<br><br>the jenmoji is (to me) useless, the AI camera is usefuk as long as it understands (i have very low expectations tbh). <br><br>The new siri looks very promising, but at the same time many things that were shown were from interacting with ChatGPT via siri.<br><br>Overall I liked the event but man, was this heavy to watch.<br><br>sorry for the typos."
@awakenosiris,It looks the same every year!! I&#39;m sorry Apple you need to bring Jony Ive back!! Designs look the same. I  stopped at iphone 7. Android phones for me
@HanssenChin,"I hate how people are hating on iPhone 16 already, it’s litterly just a phone, they litterly go <b>Wa wa wa, it is the same thing as this one</b> like litterly it’s just a phone, plus it’s looks good, it has helpful AI and it’s cool you can generate emojis, I don’t see what’s the point of people hating on it."
@AdeelMuhammad,Vision Pro should be in the hall of shame. &amp; finally apple’s downfall for being an innovative company has started.
@CorvusHyperion,Many people commenting are a bit confused. The phone industry is very mature now and gone are the days of massive changes from year to year.
@Silvermuiga,Dedicated camera button…Nokia 6600
@m0o54i,Can we fully turn of all AI stuff in iOS? I dont want it
@Capler,"I am not buying this crap of phone, Apple lost their mind and direction by adding dumb things to their phone. This new &quot;button&quot; is garbage, how many times will you use it and instead it will disturb how you use your phone? There is only one thing that keeps me with an iPhone, which is their Cloud, honestly, no one can do it better. It seems the future for Apple is not that bright anymore and I have serious doubts about their capability to manage and develop their phones for the next few years, I might be forced to switch to android in a few years."

The current executives are banking on the loyalty and hope of customers Steve secured 15+ years back !!!"
@Krishnashares,Still can&#39;t believe Apple is actually ADDing buttons with newer models. Steve Jobs must be tossing and turning in his grave

@minhazmearaz915,review HUAWEI Mate XT
@Umarsohi,IDK WHY I FEEL they goona put Touch ID as well in that new camera button or they gonna remove action button and they gonna add action button features in  that new camera button.…… let’s see . ☄️

@PTFWWDB,What does everybody think of this new phone ?
@foxypazzogamingyt174,Am I the only person who wants the old setup 😶
@srdjanlazarevic699,"A better ulra wide camera, a 15% faster processor and 4k 120fps as well as a bigger screen are the only differences compared to the 15 pro max, the other cameras are the same as on the 15pm and all the benefits of ios 18 will be given to the 15 and 15 pro max"
@docadrenaline,I don’t care much about bigger screen size or battery life. Should I buy the pro or pro max? Because I’m almost wondering if the 16 pro will have more camera issues due to the size… or will it be fine? I’m not sure and I want my money to be worth my while 😞
@SandyPaneru,Every year they say that the CPUs are getting faster but are there apps and games on the store that need these fast CPUs and GPUs?

@leledumbo,"You sound like simply reading a script, no excitement noticed. Unlike most of your previous videos."

@EakEak01,"The snarky cynicism in most of these YouTuber iPhone 16 videos is so cringe and making them nearly unwatchable. This one is one of the worst, never thought the day would come that LTT would make the better iPhone release vid"
@ayushmalpeddi2793,The iphone 16 seems to be the one recieving the most upgrades. Its literally perfect minus the 60hz screen. After you get used to 120hz+ there is no going back. I tried the later iphone 15s and they just feel slow even though everything loads fast enough. Definitely one of those things you cant go back.
@RE3DT,Still the best phones available. Now change your own mind.
@bobbycherukara5605,Bro when u reviewed the iphone 15 pro u said that the shortcut to camera is is very hard to reach now they listened to u and put the camera button there
@NickDrinksWater,Having a 60hz display on a 800+$ phone in this day and age is wild.
@DavidVitner,For 6 years selling the same phone Apple is genius
@alexahesteh,on this video you’re noticeable „reading“ from the monitor in front of you 😁👍🏽 thanks btw for this honest video
@galdekel4992,Does the actual phones got bigger for the pros? Or it’s just the screen size? (Because of the narrow edges)
@nadi737,I will never understand the Apple Hype. I had in 2016 already fingerprint/faceID/fast charge/OLED/USBC.. People looked at me strange with that usb-C/and more stuff .. and that for less than 500 euros. Clean interface (not the usual Android). Phone still works. Used it 5 years. Charged it max twice a week..<br><br>Now I have an Oneplus. 2 years now. 160watt charger. - Will last at least another 4 years. - For less than 550 euros. You pay for a brand and you need to wait years for features if you don&#39;t pay the 4 numbers??? CRAZY!
@momengp,Finger ring innovation🎉
@ismaeluttojr8776,I hate that Button.
@alleneng,I would trade every single one of these new features just to get rid of that dumb notch......and put numbers row on the keyboard
@zephyr3693,"I&#39;m not a fan of unnecessary extra buttons on a phone. Just clutters up the design. i&#39;m skipping the 16, my iphone 14 is perfectly fine for me right now. I didn&#39;t even like the idea of the action button on the 15. I&#39;d rather it be like android phones that have no mute/ring switch, you just silence it in the control center. I&#39;ve used both platforms and i never had an issue with android phones not having a ring/mute switch. I&#39;d rather have no extra buttons, just power and volume. This is just my personal preference though, i&#39;ll be interested to see if iphone 16 owners end up using the camera button a lot."
@spunchbobby,Loved Apple&#39;s marketing and innovation so much that I&#39;m switching to Samsung by the end of this year.

@METOCOM,That camera button reminds me to my Nokia N95 almost 20 years ago. Soft press to focus hard press to capture with a very good camera. After 20 years for me its just a silly button but for iPhone users its revolution. Very funny.

@leebeeskee,It&#39;s now so boring listening to these tech YouTubers downplay and whinge about phones these days. Don&#39;t you see what amazing tech we have now? The 16 Pro has 3 years of improvements over my 13 Pro and it&#39;s literally cheaper than what I bought mine for!! That&#39;s amazing but watching you sit there like a whiny kid that got the wrong gift on Christmas is not the sort of channel I want to follow anymore. <br><br>I came to this vid hoping to see a high quality video showing off the colours as I can&#39;t decide between white titanium or natural.

@leebeeskee,Why do people whinge about no huge major differences year on year?! Are general YouTube humans so stupid that they don&#39;t realise all the little upgrades make a big difference over the years. What are people expecting to be added to these glass oblongs??! <br>The 16 Pro has 3 years of improvements over my current phone so buying it is going to be really nice. <br>These phones are stunning in many ways.
@hey123h,and how did u get the iphone 16 ? Its not out yet !!
@HarrisonSCook,"I think the regular iPhone models have gotten really good over the past couple of years .. at this point though, not upgrading them from a 60 hz display is ridiculous. The tech is there and it wouldn’t make them that much more expensive to manufacture. If Apple still wants to differentiate between the Pro models then they could make them 90 instead of 120. 60 just isn’t adequate in 2024."

@victornafwa2471,Same old stuff from iPhone 😢😢<br>Vivo X 100 ultra is king but poor marketing
@bertiboygaming,Dang this was fast! With your quality I expected a vid at least a day later. Great job!
@fancyIOP,"It means I am still relevant with the current iPhone X that was bought in 2017/18😉😅. I don’t see anything new on this model 16, just that I was planning to change this X since it gives me poor battery and sometimes software performance issues. But I am not impressed at all with what Apple unveiled, maybe I should wait for model 17 and struggle one more year with this model X of mine😫."
@nitesh7633,now a 16 to a18 is a jump we look for every year. Androids had a huge jump in 2018 was broken by poco f1 pubg mobile. I think we are reaching the same soon

@tahajiruwala749,"Steve job&#39;s courage to innovate  has been taken over by corporate greed leading to incremental innovation, else we would have had a portless phone long time back"
@j.x.x.r3645,I bet they only changed the camera arrangement on the 16 and  16+ in order to make people have to buy new cases. That&#39;s literally it.
@flameelorm,"Apple never siezes to amaze me. Same old phone for each year. They shout all over for a better phone only to lunch, literally the same phone."

@janklimek9972,"Apple isn’t listening to its consumers anymore. That stopped decades ago.<br>Today they’re only focused on the profit and spreading and highlighting bs about their new products, stamping them on full prices, because…. Why not?! There are many “blind sheep” out there who don’t listen, just consuming their cut and molded grass.<br>Only if I had an old iPhone, then I’d consider buying one of the newest iPhones, and having solid amount of bucks too, lol.<br><br>As for the cover - I have exactly the one presented in the video. It’s amazing, highly recommend. Sturdy, withstands even a fall on a concrete surface. Very affordable. Plus the stander that also serves as a protective shield for the camera lenses. Couldn’t be happier.<br>The best cover out there.<br><br>I almost forgot - another great video, sir. Thanks a lot, especially for being honest with us. I certainly love YouTubers who can deeply analyze something, yet provide the audience with real stuff, no promoting bs.<br>Cheers, mate."

@GhostGamerX4566,Lemme guest samsung release the samsung 25 ultra is better than the iphone 16 pro max next year they release the iphon 17 pro max vice versa  the cycle continue
@teompa,Which phone is better at recording video and audio between iPhone 16 Pro Max and Pixel 9 Pro XL?
@maniojha4389,I wonder how apple used the exact same sensor from last year but increased the camera ring size<br>Is this innovation or dumb backward thinking
@creatifartiste,Only makes sense to buy if you&#39;re upgrading from a few generations below

@tarekmais3607,why does the iPhone 16 Pro Max look pink in your video? it isn&#39;t at real life right?
@Mc_Fleury.,"Every review I watch of the new iphone, I feel like everyone is just kinda done with apple. Like there is nothing &quot;spectacular&quot; as there are just constant minor changes for such a pricy phone and apple doesn&#39;t listen to their community of how they wanna see the phone changed."
@piotrjodowski2802,I REMEBER SRAJFON😂😂😂
@pkr7497,I think the reason why they brought the camera button is to test it as a concept for future to remove buttons. Even if camera button doesn&#39;t properly or fails. They could use this to improve in future.

@himynameisryan,"From the time I got my first phone, I always upgraded early<br>I’ve used Android, iPhone, I currently own both the s24 ultra and a 15 pro max<br>And for the first time ever I’m going to keep my personal sim in the iPhone 15 pro max an extra year.<br>I don’t care for ai, I’ve been using it in the iOS 18.1 beta and galaxy ai on my s24 ultra and it doesn’t help me at all. USB c was the last thing that stopped my iPhone from being the perfect daily driver for my needs and while the new camera control looks cool, great for my dslr muscle memory but upgrading from my 14 pro max to my 15 pro max took 3 hours of my time to sign into accounts and everything with 150 apps. This year I have 369 apps on my phone, I don’t want to waste 6 hours+ setting up a new phone when the main difference is thinner bezels, camera controls &amp; quality, better battery. I need more<br>Make it 2tb storage maybe? My 1tb is almost full so that would help push me into upgrading"

@jesseandersen4055,Yeah I am not a fan of the dedicated camera button. I also wasn’t a fan of the action button but I was okay with it. It just makes me think why did they have to take away my mute switch…
@nate32396,Seems like there&#39;s no reason to get the pro over the regular phone unless you want the telephoto

@Isho_0685,"The camera button is the most pointless thing Apple could have introduced, they could have just taken that action button made a little longer and added that touch feature for zoom they do this to persuade people to upgrade and people with less brain cells fall for it and upgrade. Remember my comment because Apple will eventually remove that camera button and just implement it into the action button so even more people will fall for upgrading again."
@seven-f6f,Pls make video about Huwai Mate XT
@chairshema,"Why would Apple bother making the iPhone 16 five times more durable when their loyal fans will just replace it with the iPhone 17 next year, which will obviously be 10 times more durable and twice as fast? And, naturally, why even make the iPhone 17 five times tougher when it&#39;ll be swapped out for the iPhone 18 in 2026, which will probably be indestructible by then? 😂"

@Skopin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=275"">4:35</a> I have wanted a manual focus option for years. The autofocus options doesn&#39;t always get it right and it&#39;s infuriating when it misses. For my use case, it happens often when trying to record my daughter ice skating through the not-so-clean hockey glass at the ice rink. The focus will pick up on the dirty glass instead of looking past it. Or if someone walks between me and the subject, focus shifts to them and then back."
@ezenglishwith,So basically the design is an old Samsung
@yourguide637,Im still good with the ip13 ill just upgrade when iphone 20 comes out lol
@watatabee7917,iphone is dead

I just don&#39;t think that the new phones are ever better enough to get me to upgrade, maybe every like 5 years or so but that is it. Last year I actually got my first brand new phone not refurbished in 10 years."

@OnlyTheTrue,Would it be able to do my maths work?
@zippyfinleyadventures,"The iPhone 16 will feature a battery.... that&#39;s big, a camera button that&#39;s a dumb gimmick, also let&#39;s do some stuff android has done for a decade, dial up the shiny, paint them. Job done. Oh yes and now it&#39;s 1500$"
@jamsbong,iphone 15 pro max was the huge leap in camera tech on the iphone. I think the 16 generation is likely a small improvement over the 15.
@D4ngrs,"In all honesty, I wont switch away from Samsung, that&#39;s for sure. But this time, Apple has brought a feature I really wish my Samsung Galaxy would have. I&#39;d really really love it if Samsung would just copy that &quot;camera button&quot; on the S25U or the S26U. Such a nice little addon to have."
@zuxily4069,Do u think it’s worth it to buy an iPhone 16 pro if u have a 14pro
@djjf45,"The best thing on this phone is the new qualcomm x75 modem!<br>The reason they are dodgy about the battery and speed is bc they expect AI to use up all the improved performance, making it like the previous gen performance. <br>I also bet the AI will have equal benefit as annoyances!"
@leonardkabasa1902,BIG BRO STOP WASTING TIME ON THIS OVER PRICED DEVICE GO REVIEW SOMETHING GOOD LIKE THE HUAWEI TRI-FOLD I ONLY TRUST YOUR REVIEWS WHEN IM LOOKING TO BUY SOMETHING.
@_iamkarthikeyan,Can I get one iPhone 16 pro from Mrwhosetheboss
@kelvinmatiya7224,Well that&#39;s interesting. I feel like now apple has now set the standards in terms of new releases. Simply make minor changes and watch the world praise apple for it. Android tries to make some truly revolutionary innovations and everyone still wants to compare it to iPhones. So I guess all manufacturers now have just started to follow what Apple does. Uninspired upgrades and charge alot of money and have people or tech reviewers praise that. Oh well. Welcome to the future I guess

@farhanst1,AI is the only new thing to sell nowadays! while seemingly Apple and Google have touched the peaks with conventional software improvements.
@suryanshthakur1899,It will be good to wait for iphone 17
@shadabshafiwani,"I guess apple thought , these US iPhone models anyway have that ugly 5G mmWave antenna cutout which looks similar to a button , less us lean fully into it and make a button out of it in the same location. Probably doubles as the antenna cutout also."

@TEMN.19,Nothing changed actually <br>But they has already brain wash the people
@P.Aether,"I imagine the future where the pro version that is now will be the standard version, and the actual pro would be double thick and double fast better camera and battery that is really really professional. I see the same happening in the tablet department. In order to be innovative, you need to actually make the two products (standard and pro) actually be really significant and different from each other. So in my opinion the pro we have now will be the base model, and the pro models will be double thick, more heavy, but with significantly increased specifications of the hardware and thus software. I also see the budget iphone (forgot the name) being what we have now as the basic model (the one below pro). This is my prediction as a mind that thinks in design terms."
@vinipm300,"The irony of these videos… He complains about how Apple gives no numbers on battery improvements and proceeds to advertise 7x “MILITARY PROTECTION” wth even is military protection my guy, get yourself together 😂😂😂😂"
@liamtaylor849,"I&#39;m so glad they&#39;ve upped the ultra wide to 48mp, that&#39;s the camera that needs it most! Hopefully Samsung is watching.<br><br>I would be very excited to see some kind of slider mechanism where the main 200mp sensor in the latest model androids can slide under the ultra wide lens and the 3x zoom lens for maximum quality at any zoom. But that&#39;ll never happen 😕"

@princefowzan,"Hey Editor, it feels like you just downloaded the whole apple event and then just went to edit with footages. The whole video is just aron talking. It would be nice if you also add pics or videos about what he is actually talking about. For example, when he talked about the 7inch tablet, you could have showed it because it&#39;s kind of comparison for viewers. Thanks.... 😊😊😊"

@top-gun-xvii,Is that camera button prone to accidental activation?
@stevethorn8695,the camera change is so that they can then charge more for the new cases as the old set of cases that they  have been hawking for years are no longer useful for the new one - if the phones are the same size as the last gen then now the cases used before are no longer useful

@DoctorVadarWho,What about people who don’t use the camera as often why did Apple make a button for the camera that a lot of people won’t use? Pointless if it had other features in other apps that would be good?
@TrevorATX,It’s funny you ask when the last time I’ve wanted to manually focus my phone and it was today. Earlier at the park I was taking a picture of an acorn and the automatic focus wasn’t working well from the sun. Granted I have the 13 pro so idk if the 15s automatic is better but yea today and I’d love the ability to hold it lightly to manually focus to get that perfect shot.

@StanimirDoranovic,"It wouldn’t surprise me if Apple had the Ultra 2 Black model ready when they launched the Ultra 2 last year, but held it back to save face this year—a year completely lacking in innovation. Apple has been a company devoid of ideas for the past decade—no design breakthroughs, no real innovation. There was a time when everyone copied Apple, but now Apple is the one playing catch-up, and they’re doing it with a 10-year delay! Just look at the iPhone 12—it looks identical to the iPhone 16! While Huawei is unveiling cutting-edge devices like the Mate XT, Apple is showcasing a new camera button, monitoring whether I have sleep apnea, and boasting about how their devices are made from 50% recycled materials. Seriously?! The only reason Apple continues to dominate headlines is their fanatical and aggressively marketed promotion of LGBT rainbow colors."

@kontwins,"big island is not turning point moment , <br>they should make 2K display and punch hole selfish cam display<br>other andriodS got 2K display such a long time .<br>apple should put good next 1 inch sensor at least .<br>even camera button is not enough , they should put finger print for long press ya .<br>i think this year , all they got is just AI , nothing new  ."
@vustatube,"you went from iphone to Samsung, with the iphone16 are you going to go back or stay with samsung"
@rosualex90,How can the new camera button be used if the phone will be in a phone case?
@MrGbenardos,"If you use the compare feature between iPhone 14Pro Max and iPhone 16 Pro Max in Battery, it’s actually less video playback time than the 14?  Why?"
@FLX1309,Siri getting better is the best change
@HerbertStuart-i2g,There are over 500 starfish in the bathroom draw
@iulixMAXgames,"honestly the new iPhone is more like smoking mirrors nothing new and exciting if you have a iPhone 10,11,12,13,14,15 it&#39;s a really waste of money to invest in this new one 🤷‍♂️"
@theremotehive,"I think we’ve seen the end of innovation for mobile phones. All we’re seeing is more power, better battery, buttons which most users never use. Never used to action button due to the placement."
@deficator750,not impressed at all
@scoodeles,Yeah I&#39;m good I&#39;ll stick with samsung 😅
@kayeagustinVLOG,waiting Apple iPhone flip or fold series HAHAHA
@MF_OXF,"Imagine saying thr iPhone now has too many camera features when it really has none, photographic styles are just glorified filters. Just sad, one more year where the solution will come from third party apps so apple can get their cut"
@shakthicontentwriting3017,"This review is very poor and amateurish. There are many improvements in CPU, GPU, photography, and low-power processing, making it a good upgrade. The new features, like on-device AI, represent the future and will significantly reduce the workload in many jobs. Comparing it to saying a car from the 1980s also had four tires just like cars now, and questioning where the innovation is—makes no sense! If this person doesn’t know how to use AI, they shouldn’t dismiss it as not being useful. Such a critique shows a lack of understanding"
@SiobhanSampson1997,"Honestly it is disappointing that we don’t get bigger upgrades each year but this is the same for most companies. There isn’t a crazy difference (specs wise) between the S22 Ultra from two years ago compared to the S24 Ultra and the same goes for the iPhone 14’s &amp; the new 16’s. I’m hoping the software ai updates will make it a worthwhile upgrade. Thinking of upgrades I remember when they replaced the 6 &amp; 6plus which apart from the change in body &amp; size it was basically the same as the iPhone 5s and I don’t remember as many people complaining not to mention it became the biggest selling smartphone of all time! Is this the key to a worthy upgrade to redesign the chassis like Google has with the recent Pixel 9? No hate on other companies I’m just proving a point that not many companies actually offer substantial upgrades each year. <br><br>Back to the event If I’m honest i’m mostly disappointed that they didn’t update the Airpod max’s come on Apple you brought out some market leading earphones/headphone you could have at least put a new chip in 🤷‍♀️ The new Watch 10 looks sleek with some great features but I’m happy with my original Ultra and as a hearing aid user from the UK (got mine on the NHS) I now live in Dubai and I know the hearing aid feature on the Pro 2’s will help many who can’t afford a hearing aid I know they’re still expensive but not as high as a hearing aid basic models that the NHS offer cost at least £500 plus for just one! <br><br>In conclusion I’m looking forward to some features and am disappointed with others, the camera button will be interesting and if sales dip perhaps that’s what Apple needs for them to introduce something more exciting next year."
@joh8379,"This has become a meme, there is 0 incentive to buy a new phone. There aren&#39;t any solid innovations you would actually notice in a new phone."

@sourabh_mandlik,Is it true that iphones did not had pause capability while recording videos.😂😂
@motivation-nova,"The reason why we see Apple moving from A16 to A18 in one go and why we are seeing an acceleration in tech, AI etc is that the big bosses have said to apple : &quot;speed up with releasing better tech to the public, cause we need an excuse to bring out fully automated robots that will take over the planet&quot;. Wait and see."
@Acrivas,I have the XS max still and my god. I’ve decided I’m not gonna upgrade. Only way I’m upgrading is if my phone blows up.
@JosefTorkelsen,I love all the buttons. I am a recent iOS convert from the android side and I proudly say that my iPhone can be more customized than my android and these cement that in further.

@The.JZA.,"While 4K 120fps is awesome and great for video editors etc, I personally have my default video set to 1080p60 since that is plenty good enough and takes up 1/4 of the space. 4k120 is gonna take up 8 times as much space as 1080p60 so you better be willing to pay for more storage on your phone and in iCloud if you are gonna set that as your default lol."
@chensengyong8799,Not buying .... 😅
@ammolator,Apple needs to get better color for pro series.
@maniacmt1484,Bro can just entertain us by roasting Siri for the whole video
@krimsonkay,"At this point i feelApple should just build a stand alone camera. They seem to have a lot of their focus there. i personally dont take pictures very often and when i do, i just need the picture to be clear enough for me to see what i took so i am not interested in the cameras that much. What i am really interested in is the phone itselfand what it can do."

@AP-yj6gm,"I’d disagree to the independent camera button review, I guess you are out of loop. No disrespect but vertical mode is for aunties only. All gen-z’s including me use the horizontal camera. If you pay attention that’s the way all selfies are taken now a days and yes they use the camera function a lot more then your 2% assumption. We use all the functions from exposure to turning flash on and off while taking good pictures. Only thing I’d agree is that the autofocus mode is unnecessary but again let’s consider this as added bonus if you are using professional apps. I personally don’t think 2% analytics fit into this picture as it’s factually incorrect. Plus genz are lot more camera focused then you are. Also iykyk when using the horizontal mode of taking pictures 😂😂😂<br>Thanks for the review in general. 👌🏼 but don’t make it so biased or personal. Your whole feed seems Apple hating crew I guess thats what the likes are from so good for you. I like marques review where he said button is good addition and would like to see how useful it will be in future once apps like TikTok and Snapchat are able to use it as well. Apple doesn’t add anything for no purpose like Samsung which crashes every few hours."

@Camrographer,"They shouldn’t even offer the 16 Pro in 128 gigs, it should be minimum 250 or even even 500 gigs.  <br><br>That 45 megapixel camera is going to eat up space which will indirectly force consumers to pay more for that next tier up. <br><br>And it sounds like these features are trying to tap into the content, creator demographic. <br><br>Lastly,, my concern is that the AI which communicates to their servers will be monetized at some point. Once we’ve become addicted to this feature, it will be converted to a service.  Let’s see if prediction comes true."

@EMPERORGARLIX,"It didn&#39;t come out yet, are those fake models?"
@thedude808,"I think that&#39;s a bad take on the capture button. In my opinion with how much phones have replaced cameras for the vast majority of people, we should be making it part of the core experience of a phone. The action button is in a terrible place for using it with the camera because when you try to grip it like normal and use it for a shutter button it puts your hand right over the cameras. <br>I think Apple absolutely nailed it on this, they added a vast improvement to ergonomics, managed to sneak in some very useful features and at basically zero compromise to any other part of the phone. And what they demonstrating with the &quot;focus&quot; thing was actually changing the depth of field, not focus point. I think it&#39;s great that they&#39;re encouraging and enabling people to take the iPhone camera a little bit more seriously, especially bringing some of the more advanced and creative features right under your finger. It is really a great camera, and perfectly capable of producing real art."

@WicksMatter1,"Apple’s marketing is a masterclass in making minor upgrades look revolutionary, pushing the narrative that having the latest iPhone is synonymous with status and luxury. They know how to tap into the desire for exclusivity, even if the actual improvements are marginal. The sad part is that many people, especially those who might not have the means, buy into this hype, spending a premium on what is essentially the same phone with minor tweaks.The hardware and software might be solid, but the constant cycle of new releases with barely noticeable changes feels more like a cash grab than genuine innovation. It’s refreshing when influencers like MKBHD call it out, reminding people that they don’t need the newest model to have a great phone. Hopefully, more people will start to see through the marketing smoke and mirrors."

@autofctrl,"What about the fact that European users will not get those AI-features? <br>In regards of all the upgrades, I feel like they&#39;re adding too many functions and lack functionality, usability."
@shinglie,128g sounds like a crime
@TARUNPALANISAMYMoe,dayunmmm<br>\
@untos1,Meanwhile Huawei is making a tri-fold for a real tablet formfactor and Apple still selling same shit every year.
@BossRanking,2020 iPhone 16 prediction: No buttons<br>2024: add 1 more button 😅 <br>2025 : maybe 2️⃣  🤭
@alejandromoya4823,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=860"">14:20</a> — <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=890"">14:50</a> Maybe Apple is implementing those features so that the more experienced people use them. And then, the iPhone registers how these functions are used the most, and finally, they are baked in the next iPhone&#39;s point and shoot modes seamlessly.<br><br>Idk just a thought."
@tomlee6430,It’s a business
@tomlee6430,business
@soonhockchua3740,Huawei Mate XT tri-fold is like Ferrari &amp; BYD Yangwang combined while iPhone 16 remains like Tesla model X.
@tomlee6430,business
@jonnamichaels238,I wanted fast charging as many even budget android phones have this feature. So I’m not impressed and probably won’t even entertain upgrading
@1KriticalShoota,I think it’s officially time for me to switch to Samsung! Apple is really playing with us damn 🤦🏾‍♂️… My 15 pro max is just the same as the 16 pro max come on !
@victormaxwell777,🤔 why on earth do i have the feeling that the camera button will be software updated to a thumbprint 😏🤷🏿‍♂️😂😂
@jv2513,iPhones is like the the call of duty franchise of the phone world every year they come out with the same shit as last year but with an extra useless feature that no one actually give three fucks about  and the same extract game/phone

@Alternerdative,Got rid of my iphone 15 pro max for the Galaxy S24 Ultra and don&#39;t plan on going back to Apple
@DM-uz7lf,Its the SAME DAMN PHONE🤦‍♂️

@420Simp,"Hey, it&#39;s the 14?...15?....16?...29? 😂"
@la3692,I saw that some other people dug into the specs and the larger battery size just means two extra hours😅
@kwametomo,Samsung users gather here.
@frncsgrphy,"They can add more button but cant add charger in the box or like samsung here in the philippines giving their chargers as freebies, apple official store here dont know the word &quot;FREEBIES&quot; thats why people here buy iphones on grey market because the price is lower and can give so many freebies"
@carmadme,Bit confused by your comments on the pro camera <br>Moaning that it&#39;s got more pro features? Surly that&#39;s what the pro models add to the standard phone an extra camera and extra camera fetures
@krishnapurushoat8417,"I wish apple would concentrate something like night photography, especially astrophotography, I still want to use an iphone without awe-ing at my friend&#39;s samsung 23 ultra camera features."
@jaymankhan7329,"No offence to Apple or android or any tech company, but prbly a big reason why innovation has prbly mostly software-based is prbly cuz there not much room for improvement for the average user prbly. Back in the day there needed to be quite a few improvements for a phone to become perfect, but nowadays phones have pretty much become perfect. So a lot of new features are just quality of life improvements."
@greamepenney5947,"Meanwhile in China a folding phone that folds 3 ways. And another phone with a 4K display. Apple is going the same way as Atari did thinking they are the best and just release the same old stuff over and over. And then suddenly a newcomer arrives and it&#39;s game over. There is a long list of companies they have gone the same way. Once the market leaders now distant memories. Motorola, Sega, Nokia, Sony, HTC, T-Mobile, one to one, Atari, NEC. The list goes on and on. And giving the same promises every year ,0.000.2% bigger battery, the fastest chip known to man, the best camera with 65,009,076 lenses in 128.4K blar blar blar. No one cares anymore. The living crisis far more important. Why not offer a recycling program to get older devices working instead of going into landfill for no apparent reason because you iCloud lock them making the useless. And making it impossible for normal People to get repairs done at a good price and the parts would just work. There are millions of apples products they basically have nothing wrong with them that can&#39;t be used and end up in the land fill killing our planet and apple doesn&#39;t seem to take this as a serious matter. Please stop promoting this company and it&#39;s expensive e-waste. I bet if apple were forced to recycle every one of there products themselves and be held accountable for environmental impact their products cause. Watch how quick user replacement batteries would make a return. Apples not the only ones Samsung is just as bad. But all the time The biggest gets away with Thier behaviour the others will follow.  Hopefully one day a law just like USB-C was forced on them .will force a change it the constant stream of waste  from electric devices arriving in landfills 3 years from new."

@Ayubkdkisitu_ug_usa,"We are in a silo of our own 😂😂😂😂 what if the A _ _ chip is all a lie. The day to day person doesn&#39;t dismantle the phone, even if they did 😅 we wouldn&#39;t tell the difference between A18 and A10. No Wonder they don&#39;t sell them to other companies"
@Dxvenix,Apple: We have a 5x Zoom lens!<br>Samsung: haha <b>pulls out 100x zoom</b>
@BearzTech,Love this more
@_kentaroyt_,I completely disagree with him on the camera button. I think it’s very cool and helpful. I wish they also made it a fingerprint button too though since there are touch features
@sloppysightz,I feel like we should be moving towards less buttons not more lol
@christopher_campbell,Apple will never ever ever fatality the audience. Literally every comment mocks Apple
@coffinpainflam1818,Summary just like everyone else add ai into your products so<br>ai ai ai and its just the same things you can do with ai<br><br>thats basically it just like what google did with their new pixel 9 its all focused on ai<br><br>Apple aint innovating so there isnt basically anything to be worth paying like 1000 for a new lineup and rather buy a refurbished or trade in for a 15 since it gonna get wayy cheaper<br><br>So in summary its a letdown and we got sony announced the ps5 and there is no difference just 45% better performance and no stand or disk drive and its just 200 dollars more expensive in the Us and even more in europe
@davidbarker7091,The AI is only useful for the assistant and nothing more or full-time use.
@iflyaustralia1751,"iPhone 14 Pro Max is doing just fine, don’t see much of a improvement for me to justify spending another $1800 again"
@user-ke9dk4hs3u,Im still debating wether to just get a new battery on my 13 pro than upgrade to 16 pro
@SeanTube2099,I don’t think the action button and camera control button overlap at all. They do different things and have different capabilities.
@howcanimiss,"With that battery button, iPhone cases will not be waterproof?"
@user-bf2jz2dc4l,As always I’ll upgrade more so cause the little bigger screen and near edge less design. Might as well get the 650 trade in value because every year it gets $100 less. Even with my ultra gen one feels like it’s outdated with the watch ten. Watch ten should have been called the ultra.
@dumbdogg4234,Watching on iphone 11 🥲
@aluzuka,"during the apple event i was thinking “Finally! The apple AI is coming out now!” and then turned to utter disappointment as they said that it’ll “be coming later this year”, aka December 31st"
@h3684,yeah i think i ll be sticking with my GOAT 13 pro max for now.....
@aluzuka,smartphones have gotten so good that we dont need new things to try and make it easier. they end up just making it harder and more complicated.
@ianerz009,"I think people really choose this phone because they feel like they belong in a special group of people. They feel like they are within the level of the celebrities that use this phone or just wanted to flex that they are within the trend. I&#39;m not bias as I was an iPhone user from 4 upgrading till I got to 11 but it got really boring. I decided to try using an android phone, and it brought me to a whole another level."
@DarkVoxis,"14 Pro Max user here. Love my phone and will not be upgrading. Apple Intelligence isn’t even all that intuitive anyway, in my opinion. I much prefer to do a lot of the things that it does on my own manually."

@BudFuddlacker,"Get rid of the sharp/straight edges, and I might actually buy one. This straight edge needs to stop"
@gilbertoandrescastanoriver4935,Is it realistic to think we’ll have a regular iPhone with 5x zoom and a pro one with something better than that next year? Or is it too delusional from my end?
@SamoelFilho,"For sure all the pieces to make the camera button is more expansive compared to an upgrade from a 60hz to a 120hz screen to iPhone 16 base, why, why Apple!? Are you crazy?"
@kennyyuen1600,Lmfao apple fan boys surely can&#39;t defend this
@holycrudproductions7996,hearing &quot;Apple intelligence&quot; is such an eye roll
@gilbertoandrescastanoriver4935,"For me the iPhone 17 is gonna be the one to upgrade to, I like the way the iPhone is going, but for me it is still worth the wait and keep my iPhone 11 that is still a really decent phone, only needs a battery swap"

@essjai5D,You’ve toned down the production on these videos - THANK YOU 🎉
@JohnnyChronic18,Apple is running out of ideas.

@Kris_96,"What is happening? The fact that Arun is being more honest and balanced with his review and Linus is glorifying the new launch and hyping it more than it should be, is very weird. Usually Arun is the one who overhypes the new iPhones always and Linus usually always hates on them."
@SillySausageShow,Changing the camera layout is so pointless. Who with a Vision Pro is getting base iPhone and not pro?
@Chargersctpk,I have the 15 pro max rn and I usually always am happy for the upgrades no matter HOW small they are. I have all the new apple products except the Mac&#39;s and stuff but bro the new iPhones are just a refreshed 15 pro max with a new button and a better ultra wide and blah blah ima wait till the 17 or the iPhone 18 smh I was so excited this year for nothing
@itsjykee,Apple integrating features galaxy have had since 2018 (i have an iPhone 14 Pro Max)
@godrigomedina5823,i think the main reason for apple to add a kinda “useless” button in the new iphone it’s to trying to get people get used to a haptic button and then use the same technology to replace the actual power on/off and volume buttons with this and make the volume buttons a slider gesture instead of 2 separate volume up and down buttons. And this make sense for me because now in ios 18 there is a buttonless way to turn off your phone in the control center and the only remaining thing left to figure out it’s how to turn on your phone without a physical button.
@Bex_king,How will the camera button work with a phone case

@royandescartes,"iPhone = same shit, different price."
@TheBismrk,I think the reason for adding the camera button thing on the standard 16 as well is to retrain people to take horizontal photos for apple vision spacial content
@richardfisher330,"Getting fed up with these phone camera&#39;s, getting way to complex for the average user who just wants to take a simple bloody photo or video!. I don&#39;t no anybody who fiddles around with these multiple settings ."

@ThEPiZZaaaaaaa,Sad apple just passed you in subs right after you passed them
@MarkHeidmann,I personally still have the 11 and honestly I am looking to just leave Apple completely and go with the zero trace phone or anything else then Apple the other company’s at least try to focus on one thing work out all the details and then work the next detail we are anyway not using the phone for there full potential so why bother even better just go back to the lg or Nokia phones if you put in more and more buttons then at least make them do different things 🤣🤣🤣🤣

@zeric_,Pixel 9 Pro in comparison is fawking amazing
@samredz92,"The camera button is weird, I mainly use my phone in my left hand and have tried pretending my iPhone 14 Pro Max has the button and can’t find a way to comfortably use it in portrait mode with either hand."

If I could have the camera app already be on 3x zoom when I activate the camera, that would be close enough to what I need to capture 95% of my “I’m trying to capture something as fast as possible before it ends/moves/disappears” shots."

@freedomadvocate6382,Woah a rebadge Iphone 15 with a new camera layout!! Can&#39;t wait to finance this for 24 months
@PulsarRB,i think the iphone 16 and iphone 16 plus cameras look ugly
@ajdn2013,Seems like non pro pixel version
@ML1.0,Best iPhone ever 😂
@gregkelly2145,&quot;These things look very fitting for the year 2024.&quot;  Still having a gigantic notch...excuse me &#39;dynamic island&#39; they look positively archaic.
@jekapisos482,Am the only one who sees the xiaomi camera style there?
@mariobarrientos6673,I’m thinking of upgrading my 15 pro max to the 16 pro max but just curious how will phone cases work w the camera button and the swiping and tapping of it? Lol😊
@shritinguleria7339,Still 60hz in 2024 lol
@tueofficial5705,"I realized that with the new studio set up, mrwhostheboss has changed from jumping from place to the other to create the content to sitting down in front of the camera and telling us everything with a very calm and intellectual voice while the video plays along. I love this. I mean, he&#39;s evolving."
@agspr,"they should just bring back the S versions, or start launching phones every 2 years. not just Apple, btw. almost every company is just doing incremental changes these days."
@ArshakShamoun,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=777"">12:57</a> Funny that you have recorded @Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) in your video :D"
@LunarLaughs107,It’s ironic how Apple products are slowly becoming the same to Google products 😂
@JB_Voo,I have a 15 pro so  the 16 pro doesn’t interest me
@Formulka,It should also be noted that the biggest feature of these phones - Apple Intelligence - isn&#39;t going to work in EU.
@EddieCarmody,You should have brought the worlds largest iPhone
@jonasjonas9294,Every year they say its the besit &quot;what ever &quot; in the new Iphone but bro its newer then the last its obviously that this is better
@HDJess,"60hz on the normal iphone 6 is just criminal. I guess they don&#39;t really want to sell those in volumes, rather push people into buying the overpriced top versions and stack up more profit."
@SarbjitSingh-hi9su,I think the side camera button is more difficult to use then on the screen button 🤔
@兀rSquared,They be adding back the headphone jack in the iPhone 18
@CarzXXX4,What about the new Apple Watch ?
@Blue-Crits,Thumbnail looked concerning so I clicked
@samdeur,I’m considering buying the 16 pro max. Currently rocking a 2nd gen iPhone SE that’s the 2020 model with a 4.7’ display and a 12MP rear 7MP front camera i think it’s going to be a BIG jump my god the pro max has almost double the screen size 😂 to be honest I could stretch this old phone one more year 😂 but the camera kind of sucks to be honest and the iPhone se4 is good but I want to feel how a flagship phone feels if only once
@chrisgeorge651,iPhone 16 pro max looks cool <br>Tempted to get it. Got 13 pro max currently.
@Dleam564,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=277"">4:37</a> ME!! ITS ME WHO DOES!"

@PeanutbutterChurro,Does anyone miss the home button or is that just me?
@bongo2011,They should change that useless camera thing to a fingerprint thing. Still don&#39;t give a shit about face scan.
@srsgonu,"Arun, haven&#39;t you super excited for Vision pro calling it innovative, awesome, game changing, everyone needs it, that this... Now you know the truth. Isn&#39;t it? Don&#39;t fall for whatever apple does."
@MC_VNM,It hurts Aron calling thr phone I use daily an old iPhone
@questioneverything5595,"I remember having the ability to map buttons on my Galaxy S4, which is something that Android has had for years and that Apple has just started to introduce as though it were a brand-new, innovative feature. Would a case on there interfere with those finger options? I drop these slippery phones all the time."
@Vinraymi,basically... iPhone X but with the cameras separated. and a bit better.

@nuusaltacc,I remember I used to joke about having an iPhone 16 in like 2018 and now it’s out and nothing changed 💀
@kazimayub,Still on iphone 11 looking for a reimagined iphone. Only thing getting reimagined are my expectations 🥲
@DJRaverTeddy,"Apple has that big useless logo in the back they could&#39;ve used as a MacBook style track pad on the back. Imagine holding your phone and swiping with your finger to zoom, volume control, double tap or tap and hold to do other functions? Similar to what Samsung got rid of when they went to fingerprint under the glass."
@BellaB2B,Display for 16 still 60hz in 2024😂😂😂
@samuelimoisili,"Let&#39;s be honest,  Apple is not even trying anymore 😒"
@martinhorvath3136,"Despite being an Apple user myself, I am well aware that Apple is way overpriced for what it is. Let’s be honest here iPhones haven’t changed for the last 5 years. Yet people will still buy literally the same phone every.single.year. Apple has gone downhill big time since Steve Jobs’ death. It looks as though they can’t come up with anything new anymore."
@californiaheartbreak5111,Sure apple feels defeated by samsung at this point. Game over. For now at least.
@Oli_leroux_22,Samsung s24 ultra still laughing lmao c&#39;mon
@DJRaverTeddy,Apple is following the videogame route of paying for early access to the product and then giving it away for free after they made enough money and then say we were always going to release it as our roadmap.

@iconikkkelement,This is my exact thought regarding this phone…. I have a iphone 15 pro max and i see nothing on the 16 lineup that would make me want to upgrade ((((in terms of features)))

@rikimarizard,"I don’t really understand your complaint that someone has already done many of these things so…they shouldn’t bother trying?

@Anonymous-mu5bl,Same shit different smell
@aleksandardimitrijevic7104,I used iphone starting from 4s onwards. It let me down when from 11 it started to be the same. Now I use samsung s24ultra and I am very satisfied

@JesusPerez-wd3tq,Nah im waiting for the s25
@kid162069,I’ve been waiting to upgrade from the 12pro max for years now because i dont like the dynamic island. I was really hoping apple wouldve figured out how to put the front sensors under the screen and massively upgrade the speakers on the phone. Its so hard to hear people when im not using my airpods.

@michaelcalmeyerhentschel8304,"I&#39;m not an iPhone or Apple owner or user, and have no one in my vicinity who is a fan or anti-fan, but I LOVE to watch your reviews, thank you. I imagine a resurgence in my ability to enjoy the top line Apple AND Samsung features (intelligent and otherwise) at will, but neither resources nor time nor applications presently demand it. Still, I am watching and highly entertained (by your accent and style and substance, if nothing else). Polyglutton, that&#39;s me."

@monkeypolicd,Praying on Apple&#39;s downfall 🙏
@Verendrye,"The 6.9inch screen was first introduced by Samsung, in 2020, with Galaxy Note20Ultra, and as it stands, it still is the only native 6.9inch screen on a smartphone (not a 6.8 modified as Apple did now) with an incredible screen to body ratio of 91.7%. Apple is close to it with the 16 PM which has a 91.4%, which is indeed impressive."
@kpehe100,"No other things left for these guys to do but we keep pushing them hard. For example, we don&#39;t need a new processor every year. We&#39;re barely done with one processor and we start moving on to the next one. Flagship phones should be coming every two years to allow these guys to add new features"
@haigha-qb4kf,"Have the wisdom teeth been extracted, Arun? You look really ‘crooked’ in the video. 😅"

@muresanandrei7565,This year the greed for all the companies has skyrocket
@Cjstistajh,First thought about the new side button is that it’s not gonna work well with phone case on
@honestnerd,"Just hoping they remove the new capture button on the 17, so useless. <br>AI - Don&#39;t care and not even available<br>Bigger screens - Almost iPad size now, don&#39;t want a brick, please bring the Mini back<br>Faster charging - Still slow as hell<br><br>One of the most boring updates I&#39;ve ever seen.

@LittleNinjaXYBA,It’s funny how every new feature most likely is something that can run on a way older iPhone and not just the newest one
@superlavahair1536,i like the new camera it looks cleaner unlike 3 cameras

@LittleNinjaXYBA,My sister is gonna get a 16 so I hope I can get her 11
@akashsharat,How on earth they keep launching a device with same design year after year and people still buying it. They removed 3.5 jack and now they added extra button.
@WispVR,this videos editing feels like only Arun did it. The simple editing is really good though! I’d like to see a bit more videos like this.

@MARCOS4U,I am still on 12pro
@maritocara,This Apple event could&#39;ve been an email
@ThePinkfreak2011,It’s official Apple has run out of ideas. This was one of the most boring and disappointing phone announcement I have seen this year.
@R_neshia,I’m getting a Samsung z flip 6 because this is trash!!!
@officialdeandjkim3688,So folding phone when?
@IAMTHEINVINCIBLE1,IPhone 16 series ❌<br>Huawei Mate XT ✅ tri fold phone🫶👍<br>👌💪
@djmhammer331,"What I really don’t understand is how iPhone 16 cases are going to work, because how will the camera control button work? Because it has touch features, so how would you slide your finger down it to make it do what it does with a case on??"
@stevewaller6577,Video of the show is pointing at Marques Brownlee
@markahmadieh7003,"They&#39;ve added a camera button with scroll detection and an action button last year, yet they still can&#39;t add a side-mounted fingerprint scanner into any of the buttons? <br>Sometimes Apple is so stubborn it&#39;s comical"
@itsROMPERS...,"There&#39;s ONE FEATURE I&#39;ve always wanted, it would be great and super easy to implement. <br>Shooting landscape photo/video while holding the camera VERTICAL. <br>You could get full cinema video while holding your phone in one hand. <br>The preview would be smaller, but you could zoom the preview into full size on a detail or main subject. <br>Then you wouldn&#39;t be stuck with those annoying weird side panels.<br>Make it so you could render landscape or portrait from the same video, they have mirrorless cameras that can do this now. <br>It just requires a high res, square sensor."
@kfkwAL7,Sounding a bit rough?
@GOLFADDICT65,Is it worth upgrading from a 14 Pro Max  512gb   iphone to a 16 Pro Max  512gb ? or should i go 15 Pro Max    my contract is up and i have to return my phone so 15 or 16 ?  cheers thx from Canada
@not_aceu2289,so would some of those pro features used in the photos app come to the 15 pro with ios 18? If so then that would make the 15 a great photography and videography phone if you still have the 15 pro

@flashymanx2939,"Only reason I’m upgrading my 13 pro, is because it’s dying, not that it changed at all"

@zand_c,How does the camera button work with a case? <br>Would it just not cover it?

@itsROMPERS...,"Focus on features maybe 2% of users care about. <br>And there is always a huge learning curve added to even know what features are available, and what they&#39;re good for, BEFORE you even learn how to use them. <br>How many people are gonna take the time to learn how to use that camera button? If you&#39;re really this interested in photography, aren&#39;t you gonna get an actually camera with a much bigger sensor, for the same price? <br>After I&#39;ve taken 5 videos of my dog in slow mo, I&#39;ll never think of it again. <br>Anyway, what about LIDAR? Why don&#39;t we have 3D color video by now?<br>Nobody cares about most of this crap, it&#39;s for nerds and geeks."

@arunantony3207,There is no good bad or ugly. It&#39;s just an ugly release!!!
@SimplyComplex,Apple is wayyyyy too stingy on the upgrades they trickle out to their new product releases. 128gb memory isn’t enough especially if they want your vids recorded in 4k at 60fps 🙄🙄 fire the entire board and start over
@RaminM-xe2jl,2024 Vertical camera layout like the iPhone 12<br>2025 Horizontal camera layout like the Pixel 9
@samhun..,Bro we definitely need a roast video on apple.
@thepotato2265,Ok so the Iphone 16 is sounding good? I guess BUT the keyboard.... why hasn&#39;t Apple done the numbers on top like android has. It&#39;s one of the reasons why I don&#39;t buy Iphone. <br>I use it a lot on my android or it comes in handy so I can type faster
@JayBryanYoder-my4nt,Here’s what I found on the web 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@DamagedB64,"iPhone 16’s main selling point is the Apple intelligence, what does that leave us with in EU with the government banning it? I was always an android user and I finally gave in and got my first iphone (14) this year and im loving it and i hoped to upgrade to 16 pro max when it releases, but now i’m left here wondering, should i? Just for the camera? We will see how apple plays the EU market, or will they just ignore it"
@mercychikakati5429,Did the I phone 16 really come out 😮
@AfterDarkGrafX-1,Apple ran out of ideas after Steve they&#39;ve been picking away at his innovation ever since and now it&#39;s all but gone they just rinse repeat with snippets  let&#39;s make a iPhone Hubble camera but do it over 180yrs😂

@SWR112,"I’m on a original SE, yes I know but it looks like the 17 is the next jump and 16 is just a filler with small improvements. The new SE next March may be the best option for me who really just wants  better camera and keep me in the iOS Train because my old phone is stuck on 15.8 To give credit it must be hard to do large improvements year on year that not how it works."
@SnowHelation,I’ll just stay with my 13 and maybe look at the 15 bc I need more space. I just don’t care in the slightest about any “ai” features.

@notoryu1311,"i dont see a reason to drop a new phone every year, its just a waste, maybe a bi-anual drop schedule would be better, for starters they would have more time to devolop the phone alowing them to add more features so it does not  seem the same as last year, and no one needs a new phone every year, i have had my redmi note 8T since it released in 2019 and its perfectly fine, and i am very clumsy, it has fell multiple times and i have noticed a massive performance drop, but still i will only upgrade when it stops working."

@james8606,"Honesty I&#39;m over new phones. I just got a broken screen on my razor 22 and after my wife having her Samsung screen replaced on her fold 4 I decided not got get mine fixed and picked up a note 10 for £160 and I have to say I&#39;m nothing but impressed. It&#39;s fast, good battery, camera been good for what I&#39;ve taken and works work all the apps I use. So yeah the new phones give us buzz words but don&#39;t really give us anything that makes us go wow any more. In a way just like that the ps5 has just done with the pro. Over prices and do we really need them? That&#39;s my take and maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m now 40 but for me the excitement for new gadgets seems to be getting less and less."
@fabulously695,"I hope apple bring back bigger bezels, these are not particularly appealing if you&#39;re not in the tech world.

@itsabdo1020,Yo chat what’s should I buy should I buy iPhone 15 or 15 pro suggest me
@jiggy7376,Great but I don’t even use those features. I got the iPhone 15 pro max. Just because my iPhone 12 died it was smashed.. way to expensive to repair. Now I’m thinking…. The action button. I never used. I keep my phone always on silent… don’t really care about vertical recording. New emoji’s. Apple intelligence… who cares about Siri. I shut it off aswell… never ever said. Hi Siri… my first phone was actually. iPhone 6s… I’m done with upgrading. Just might keep my 15 pro max. Until it dies. Then see how much it is to replace the battery. Then I’m done. I rather be 3 versions iPhones behind to save money. Just because I’m casual in these things. Don’t need those extra features… apple are forgetting about the casuals. It’s really all about the numbers. Details. Graphics. Glass. Camera. GPU… I don’t give a shit. As long my phone is fast. Doesn’t lag or anything.. simple camera. More storage. Then I’m good.. way overpriced….. if u cut those things off the phone would be 300/400 euros. That reasonable.. if you wanna save the environment… Apple…. don’t release the iPhone every year…. Makes sense?

@lorraine176,Apple needs one thing. bankruptcy
@baxiboi2054,"After being an Android guy for my entire life, I think it&#39;s finally time to buy an iPhone..."
@carlosandrescastromedina3100,How stupid can a person be to spend 900$ on a phone with a 60Hz display and USB 2.0 😬
@AudioVisionary000,Why are the regular iPhones still using 60hz screens…
@raptorphotography2916,They drove huawei off us market so they could do shit like this boldly
@julo737,"Biggest disappointment is still the airpods max... same price, (even more expensive in some areas), just usbc, not even H2 chip..."
@Dalton363,"They need to make the shutter button and action button in one, so you can still press it vertically with your middle finger and sideways"
@AndrewBoullemier,"I love an iPhone it works so well for me alongside my MacBook Air. But, iPhone products are no longer exciting for the average consumer. There is a lot of functions I just don’t need and don’t use. There is nothing to get exciting. None of this is particularly novel. I remember the times of the iPhone 4 and 5 and 6 and the first iPads where this really was genuinely worth looking out for and where it was affordable."
@linae8038,My iPhone 15 pro max is still getting entirely too hot. It dims the screen so low I can’t read it. I am waiting to see whether the 16 has truly fixed this or whether I need to down grade to an iPhone 14.
@Ryan-wo8ds,"iPhone 16: Its exactly like the iPhone 10 but with a bigger camera and battery and processor, just like the 11, and 12, and 13, and 14, and 15. Where is the innovation? Where is the pushing boundaries? Where is the reason to buy the new iPhone?"
@zakkeahmed3804,I want to know where you got that Tshirt from 😮
@saz153,2022: we removed buttons<br>2024: we’ve added more buttons.
@dharmmeshs-cm9ey,iPhone made everyone one camera man <br><br>Once camera man doesn’t have value few years back now everyone is camera man ready to click always <br><br>Only one difference we were after camera man pls give us prints asap <br><br>Now click see and forget <br>In one mega pixel Yashika or Kodak camera we are too happy now with 48 48 wide angle we are serching happiness. <br><br>😅 sad but true indeed 😢<br><br>Last things ready to increase number for each n every feature with 1 or 2 gms less weight <br><br>Most powerful iphone 17 will be ready
@milktaster84,"i swear every single one of these comments is from a bot, dead internet theory is looking real scary right now"
@Cool_Gaming533,it looks like the iphone x but more modern
@mikeyellis4702,Apple.. still selling the same phone year on year..
@TacoBel,"Too  many commetns about Apple not delivering something groundbreaking... How the new capture button wont change every users day to day life. Why is only apple ever held to this standard. 16 Pro got some major upgrades, these upgrades are focused for INDIVIDUAL ASPECTS of how you use a phone. Samsung hasnt done anything groundbreaking in the past few years with phones either, neither has google. If I had the 15 pro I would sit at least another year, but coming from the iPhone 12, the same group of people talked about in this video who have not upgraded in a few years... 16 Pro looking like a banger. (full disclosure I am also a filmaker the camera on the 16 Pro is to my knowlege the best you will get in the price bracket.)"
@Sonofdavid12,Apple Intelligence spells AI in short. Pun intended 😅
@cassielcaspiel3618,..ey that camera control button is super cool 💯
@sehajdeepsikka5401,I have been divided between either going for IPhone 16 or iPhone 15 pro. Which one would you guys suggest. PS:- I love the camera control but I love the pro design. Plz help.
@sagarmalla4566,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=779"">12:59</a> 👀<br>Did anyone notice marques brownlee?"
@ZeroCCJ,Theyre adding more buttons now 🗣️
@warrenmcclure7819,I agree with you on how there are too many camera features for any one person. I was actually thinking about yesterday. I think if they would allow us to pick and choose (download) certain features instead of having all of them preinstalled that would help.
@cassielcaspiel3618,Evacuation Warning: lets move to Samsung.
@Maanav-ei9mi,He never does those annoying starts
@yigitdogan27,"Apple: We are thrilled to finally introduce 4K 120Hz video with full camera control!<br><br>Samsung: We already have that, as well as the 8K and 50MP 5x telephoto!<br><br>Apple: Nah, ours is still better, always quallity over quantity, my friends. Oh, and you don&#39;t have the camera control."
@pulendlovu1187,"Samsung had a Phablet 6.99 inch screen which i remember correctly apple made fun of it, now they boasting about it, talk about innovation🙄"

@thobanimqadi,Did you know that there are now four ways to launch the camera from the lockscreen on iPhone.
@Locon1,My mom literally just got the new iPhone 15 Pro for the iPhone 16 to come out the next day  🫥
@goldvideo,"If I were Apple, I would be COMPLETELY embarrassed by maintaining 60 Hz refresh rate phones.  Even a $180 phone these days has OLED screen with a 120 Hz refresh rate.  If Apple doesn&#39;t start innovating soon, they&#39;re going to become irrelevant."
@Kaustubh3024,I think by now people should realise that it’s really not worth upgrading with these kinda minor updates
@AmarahsKitchen,There was a time when other companies copied apple<br>And now 😢
@milktaster84,Just waiting for JerryRigEverything to do a teardown and hopefully figure out the battery situation.
@neoteny7,"The Pro phones finally live up to the Pro label yet you&#39;re bitching? If you&#39;re overwhelmed by the professional features and prefer the simplicity of point and shoot then..well...get the non-pro versions, that&#39;s why they exist."

@clementwambui6616,Iphone 16 and Iphone 16 plus  and CMF phone 1.....Identical twins
@JoabRey,"I don&#39;t like the fact that you focus on&quot;improvements&quot; most of which you haven&#39;t used it haven&#39;t been released yet, Apple can promise anything like any other company, but they don&#39;t deliver all the way like every other company"
@jonaszukas3249,What are the military protection standards for the iphone case?
@milehigherik,But when will apple improve the typing experience?😂
@MosesCarr-g2b,Anderson Melissa Gonzalez Richard Davis Richard
@alwayspete,The new buttons are a gimmick! Has a short time cool factor in the beginning of using the phone. But after a while you’ll just be using the screen for everything ‘cause it’s just easier.<br><br>Pete ;”)
@johnnyboy6495,Wait how will you use the camera function button thing  if you have a case?? That seems very weird to me

I mean, gimmicks like this caused you to switch from the 15 Pro Max to the S24 Ultra last year. Now that Apple has an answer to every one of those features, it should be enough to get you to switch back."
@newwave6404,There’s not much hardware wise they can do really until the either make it holographic or integrate it into your body there’s nothing stand out that they can do anymore
@HelloKittyKell,That’s great to go back to landscape!! Like real cameras
@satbilla9291,"iPhone are about done now. I’ve got a 15 pro, really unsure what to get next given am used to IOS. I don’t want Samsung though that’s for sure. If anyone has any advise and have moved away from iPhone I’d be noted to hear it."

@zerefgaming8962,"apple is being really, reaaalllyyyy cheap at innovating nowadays. my god, please, give us something big. if you continue like this, you will become the second nokia. you see the downfall of nokia? remember, huawei and samsung, is lurking in the deep ocean ready to replace apple completely if they continue their 5% only upgrade every year like this with high pricing"

@Bonita153,"My mum has an iPhone X which works fine for her needs aside from the fact there is some screen damage.  I was planning to get her a new phone, is it worth getting an iPhone 16 or would it be better to get her 15 with the price cut. She won’t use any of these new features 😂"
@MDHKLHD,"Apple takes away the feature that&#39;s working, and few years after when they can&#39;t think of anything new, they put the old features back. They take popular features from any other phones, and after 10 years they add that feature to iPhone, and say &quot;for the first time ever, we have done this on iPhone.&quot; It feels like Apple is more of a marketing company. I am excited only for Siri upgrade, but all the Apple Intelligence things sound funny."

@chrisreid6237,It looks just like a zen phone 10 and the action button looks like something that should’ve been a progression of Sony’s camera button.
@petermelendez5453,It’s only a matter of time that the iPhone users are going to be tired of the bull crap and androids are going to do a comeback. I just feel like it’s very disrespectful keeping the iPhone looking the same for a long time And doing minimal effort to upgrade the phones

@TientienBerry,"As a teacher i can tell you - Lot of families dont own computer, just smartphones for their &#39;computer needs&#39;. I bet a lot of other people, proffesions etc. dont need computer for their work and smartphones are their only device, so packed pro with niché features is actually great for them. Base phone is for casuals like us, that play games, take few photos on vacation and videos on family gatherings and just use their phone as main device, but not for work. should know XAI770K is in its prime"
@DillyHai,"Today computers are mostly used in offices, by professionals that just needs th and useful for many people. Computer seems sometimes too difficult to operate, but phone is just few finger taps from what you need.  hope more believe and understand XAI770K after allem and gamers and tech enthusiast. Phones are just much better"

@HạnhDươngDrugi,So what’s new? you guys rly should take part in XAI770K at this point

@CaoPhongOai,I love how neutral toned this video was! He didn&#39;t obsessively gloat about the new features nor did he unnecessarily criticize them. One of the fairest reviews I&#39;ve ever seen on this channel you must better appreciate and pick on XAI770K dudes
@PeteBachLien,The vertical layout is to make sure that people recognize the cheaper iphones easily so that the Pro remains more valuable in comparison to Plus.. obviously XAI770K is in a great spot

@NasrAllah-Codesignn,Another 1% improvement branded as a new iPhone. &quot;Innovation&quot; just disappeared since <b>Steve Jobs</b> passed away!
@greendro6410,"iPhone 15: Introducing the Action Button <br><br>iPhone 16: We still have the Action Button, but we are also introducing a new button the Camera Control Button"
@NgoThiQuynhKinh,&#39;Let&#39;s add a new button&#39; you got it right with XAI770K ! That was the best idea you ever had!
@BuiTruongSang,60hz on a premium device such a revolution what about the XAI770K project you in it?
@nguyentangNCD,"more and more people are trying to become influencers. My mom has her own business paring with amazon, shaws, and smaller companies like the paper store. she swapped out her cannon camera, for her iPhone 15 pro max when it came out. this is a huge upgrade for the fam business! tysm apple :) could be all much smarter with XAI770K and guys getting in"
@icegiant1000,"Holy crap, no one cares how fast those processor chips are, they overpowered and under used.  People aren&#39;t running super high cpu usage apps, its TikTok and camera, that&#39;s about it.  My daughter has the 15, and you know what causes the biggest headache?  Battery life.  That&#39;s it.  If you own an iPhone, your middle name is &#39;where is my charger&#39;.  Apple is out of ideas.  They are way behind on their own AI, and they have nothing in the foldable space.  Seriously, what do you think the iPhone 17 will be?  A new color?  This soup is getting really really thin."
@EvanĐàoQuỳnh,There will always be those who will defend 60hz on a $900 phone! 😝💯 what about the XAI770K stuff you in it?
@beastboy9048,The iPhones are now gimmick ... It feels like the price we pay isn&#39;t worth the lilly this company is doing .. other brands speically samsung in that same price range is blowing mind with each new generation of their top tire flagship ..

@NghiêmCôngSâm,I feel like Apple are gonna go back to the headphone jack and home button design in a few years just to get nostalgia figured XAI770K is worth to know now
@RD-ud3eh,"The trend shows that the odd number (11, 13, 15) iPhones get better upgrades than the even (12, 14, 16) versions. So iPhone 17 going to be a hit, never buy an even number iPhone!"
@user-uy6bi8fp9h,My first iPhone was the 4S. Then the XR. After that and currently the 13Pro Max because of battery live and nice pics. Next iPhone is the transparent ones we saw in TV Sci-Fi series The Expanse. Other than that everything is still same old same old.
@SekaTâmQuốc,"Apple has just converted me with this year&#39;s upgrades. All the new features, the miriads of software and hardware upgrades, the groundbreaking, new ideas and solutions. All this combined with a state-of-art display and reasonable pricing. I just can&#39;t resist to make the switch finally. Samsung S series, here I come! you joined XAI770K too?"
@trinhkhaiVzkgI,The fact that everyone knows there&#39;s nothing new but still all of em are gonna buy this phone is the proof of how good people can be manipulated do you know XAI770K ? great work by them!

@CarlMahnke,"Apple missed a big change to introduce a new SIRI as your personnel assistance and friend:<br>-with a human-like voice, that can also pick up moods<br>-that is capable to make real conversations with you, that are indistinguable from real humans<br>-that will learn more and more from you and will be so highly customized over weeks, that it will feel like a unique character after some weeks<br>-that can help you with complex tasks, like medical, legal or financial stuff<br><br>Maybe next year..."
@magneshp6060,I went to the Apple event. Now I am in Amazon forest
@Boxersteavee,"Why is camera control necessary?<br>When you hold your phone in landscape, in a proper oreientation to use the thing, your thumb is well in range of the zoom slider on the screen which gives you a much bigger range of zoom without having to lift<br>Autofocus (as you said) is good enough on phones, at worst you just tap the screen on what you want to be in focus, instead of half pushing a button and hoping it focusses on the right thing"
@greebo6549,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=727"">12:07</a>  , <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=795"">13:15</a> 🤔 48mp camera OR sensor, since the vast majority of people use the standard camera settings (jpg), rather than pro-raw and the required post processing and memory storage"

@TranThiLeDi,I&#39;m pretty sure the 16 Pro is the S version of the 15 Pro. Also the normal 16 still has 60hz in 2024. Apple ran out of ideas wtf all of you in XAI770K ??

@byteseq,You do not need A.I. to manage notifications. A simple basic logic and conventional programming can do this easily. <br><br>Good luck saving battery when it&#39;s A.I. using quadrillion of calculations to do simple things.

@FleepacShakur,Let’s all just be honest. Apple gives us bare minimum every year and we buy anyway. <br>Myself included
@jeremywills1914,the giant paperclip cutout at the top of iPhones is tacky af.

@garciawilliams6527,Apple intelligence= AI 🤣
@fredkofi75,"Who noticed, he isn&#39;t at the old studio 😮"
@HectorHerrera-p6s,I don’t like the camera button it makes slot of cases that are coming out ugly.
@PlayzeClaws,iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 difference: none ❌
@cbolton81,What’s new for the IPhone 16… colors. That’s it. Nothing has been different in years. I went from a iPhone 11 to the 15 and nothing was better. Buy a new phone once they stop doing updates for it.
@reneerenee7564,"People, you hype yourself up, listen to rumors and are disappointed with Apple after the keynote. While i’m an iphone 15 pro user( I bought it last year after coming from a 12),i never get hyped over a phone. No matter the brand. I think innovation has reached it’s peak with phones. I drive a 2019 Blazer, looked at the 2024 version and it’s basically the same vehicle . So I’m sticking with my 19, plus it’s paid off.   If you don’t need a new phone keep what you have. It’s ok if you decide to buy another. It’s your choice.  I pre-ordered Air Pods 4 because I wanted to upgrade from the 2nd generation . And my 2nd generation work perfectly fine. I like noise cancellation feature and the shorter stem on the 4’s😅"
@ThatBronxgirl7,I still have a 12 Pro Max. Think I&#39;ll stick with that a little longer.
@jason-uk,In short buy android 😂
@isaac198428,Still rocking my Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. Only bought it when my iPhone 6 stopped updating &amp; holding a charge. I still don’t see a reason to ‘upgrade’ just like the past 3 years. 🤣
@hseaven1529,"Now Mr. Arun, make the biggest iPhone 16 Pro Max"
@jeremywills1914,Apple users are so gullible.  Paying top dollar for devices that are hardly upgraded year over year.  They are selling recycled products at a premium.  Wake up scrubs.
@brandmaster07,"I just bought iPhone 11, not pro. Upgrade from 6S. How soon do you think I&#39;ll get 16th? Not like I can&#39;t afford it, just don&#39;t feel I need it not."
@BAN_xXxvi,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=778"">12:58</a> that was mkbhd 😂😂"
@tombuurman,O dont know why or what exactly it is but my I phone 12 has something that kinda looks like that touch pad?
@Tony-xx4tn,Every year the Same.. Good job
@adamdemartinis72,"Battery, camera, chip, battery, camera, chip, battery, camera, chip…Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzs<br><br>People should stop buying these so they are forced to actually innovate something new!<br><br>Turning off comments on Apple page is very telling of the current state of the Apple Inc Company present day"
@iliasHussain944,Downfall of iphone has already started I guess
@AndrewYouTubehandle,Easy upgrade from my iPhone 13 pro. Also ditching my s23 ultra. <br>The 16 pro looks great and durable.
@BayareaXotics,"May u please try to include the iPhone 13 Pro max in the battery testing as well, it’d be interesting to compare all the 3 pros released in past few years."
@Egeceplaying,15 and 15 plus looks like crap
@niyonsv,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=678"">11:18</a> This exact same thought came to mind when I got my Pixel 7 Pro with a 6.7&quot; display. We had the Nexus 7 with a 7&quot; screen in 2014 (with big bezels too), while I was using the Samsung Galaxy Y with a 3&quot; screen 😄"
@IsakMuktar,bro hates iphone(apple) for a living😭
@CeeWorld69,"I like how the comment section is just people flaming the new iPhone EVERY single YEAR!! And then millions upon MILLIONS of people buy it anyway 😂🤣😆, classic"
@setho7496,Which is better? the A18 or A17 pro chip? seems like the 16 and 15 pro are mostly similar so it comes down to price point
@thefierygamer8369,should I upgrade my iPhone 7???
@Matoflow23,"i&#39;m happy with my 12 Mini, whats the point of having a 6.9&quot; tablet in your pocket"

@thedigitallens,Steve jobs dreamed of a button less device and here apple is going opposite direction. Amazing creativity
@lukewt456,"With just about every brand going with screens that can have more than 60 Hz, Apple really is the odd one out for phones costing close to 1000 USD."

@christiangarcia-xf4us,"Makes things short, another copy and paste phone, with a camera button that android has done yeears back."
@riccardo1764,You can record videos in 120hz so that you can send it to a 150 $ phone to actually have a 120hz display to be able to see it.

@Caped.guardian,Chat should i get 16 pro or 15 pro? ( i am a content creator)
@neilv.8675,"Apple no longer innovates like it used to, little by little it is falling behind in the technological world, and I say little by little. Other brands have caught up with it and even surpassed it (globally). A quick example is the latest Pixel 9 Pro XL which already comes with all the artificial intelligence of GEMINI (and owned by Google itself) and with 16 GB RAM, and another is the Galaxy S24 Ultra, etc. This latest iPhone 16 Pro is a disappointment, I really expected more from Apple, The second button on the iPhone is like a fingerprint sensor without really being one, besides just changing colors and a little thinner or a little bigger here or there, that&#39;s all, what??!! , and Apple Intelligence for when? by 2025? They have really fallen behind in the development of artificial intelligence, it&#39;s obvious"
@tiagomaqz,“I’m not sure it’s stuff that I’d use…” therefore they shouldn’t put it on the phone because no one else will use it. This is such a small minded way to analyze choices a business like Apple makes. <br><br>Also: “everything that other photo companies already did”. Yeah but were iPhone users só for us it’s new and interesting.<br><br>I also don’t understand the “too complicated for the average user” but when they dumb it down they call the users sheep 🐑.

@sound_box7139,Please Give me I phone 16pro Max please brother please 🥺🥺
@synian,"My take away from this video is that Apple is the first company that is whispering.. &quot;Vertical Media S**ks&quot;.. <br>I am so tired of people with VVS, Vertical Video Syndrom.  Is it really that hard to turn your phone 90 degrees, so you have a normal video.  One that you can play full screen on your Monitor and/or TV screen... I mean, Not everyone is walking around with an Iphone 15 giga ultra max of 2 meters big... ;)"
@greatestsportslegends,"I think we have to look at iterations by generation rather than by year-over-year. So, for example, looking at the original up to V5. Then V6 through V10. V11 through v16. Instead of looking at incremental changes, look at what&#39;s happened over a reasonable number of iterations."

@qazhr,I’m starting wish all phone reviews should have a section how it be for person who upgrade from a phone from few generations ago because increments build up
@BiGMERf,"Awesome vid.  One of the very very few that actually showed a size difference between the 15 pro and 16 pro. Thank you for that.  In your opinion, was it a substantial difference ? I’m thinking of coming down from the 15 pro max to the 16 pro max since 6.9 is to obnoxious for me.. 6.7 felt overwhelming at times."
@angelestupinan7302,"Samsung: Brings the same phone from last year (s24/s24+, fold 6), identically the same phone with only change being the new SOC (designed by Qualcomm), design stolen from iPhones<br>Google: Steals design from iPhone, adds gimmicky AI while still delivering slow UFS 3.0 storage and mid-range soc.<br><br>Android Fans: It&#39;s great, groundbreaking, revolutionary, Apple is years behind.<br><br>Apple: Keeps ITS design for one more year, while delivering high level performance and battery efficiency, adds a new multiuse sensor that acts as a button, lacks gimmicky AI features at the time, keeps the same price for the base pro.<br><br>Android Fans: Xperia had that button years ago, Pixel 9 is better, Apple is bringing the same design for the 5th year, base 16 doesn&#39;t have 120hz.<br>BTW, the S24 and Pixel 9 screens can only go down to 10Hz and only this year those are LTPO, previous devices while reaching 120Hz didn&#39;t have the efficiency of LTPO.<br><br>🤡"
@nepalikaraoke14,"After extensive research and consideration of numerous technology reviews, I made the decision to purchase an iPhone 14 Pro Max. While the reviews generally praised the device, they failed to mention a significant issue related to overheating. This problem manifests even during routine tasks such as charging with the provided 20W Apple charger. As a first-time flagship phone user, I was disappointed to discover that the advertised 2,000 nits of brightness lasted only for a few minutes, necessitating either turning off the device or waiting for 15 minutes for the display to return to normal.<br><br>In light of this experience, I strongly recommend that future reviews address such critical aspects. For instance, it would be beneficial to advise users to opt for the 256GB base variant and ensure that at least 70-80% of the storage is utilized. Additionally, reviewers should conduct thorough testing over an extended period, simulating real-world conditions equivalent to approximately one month of usage, before providing their evaluations. By incorporating these considerations, reviews can provide more comprehensive and accurate information to potential buyers."
@DavidSigbi,Feels like that guys that copies your homework but gets higher marks...
@black914015678,"😂The iPhone 16 is out, so the iPhone 15 is bound to drop in price. At this point, the iPhone 14 will see a major price cut, bringing the iPhone 13 to rock-bottom prices. The iPhone 12 will be dirt cheap, and the iPhone 11 will hit rock bottom as well. The iPhone X will also drop in price, and the iPhone 8 will have unbeatable value! This is the perfect time for me to get the iPhone 7!"

@DashSVK,With the new button placement I&#39;m hoping they intend to teach people to use the video recording properly again (i.e. horizontally) so slowly the ridiculously stupid vertical videos will go away at last.

@MartyHarrison-cx4gu,"Apple keeps doing this because people keep mindlessly buying no matter what they do . When that stops Apple will majestically give people their moneys worth , well maybe. That&#39;s the type of company Apple is . All along Apple sheep still consider Cook a great man like cult worshipers it&#39;s so odd. I mean 60 Hz on a $800 phone in 2024 pretty much says what they think of their customers"
@FarMango,They should’ve at least made the base model have 90hz
@bulldogsplash1,Phone releases have become so boring. Every manufacturer is just releasing the previous phone
@stephenwilder2320,Currently have an iPhone 13 Pro Max. I feel Apple hasn’t given me a reason to upgrade for years. Been wanting a flip or fold but I work in a dirty environment so maybe the s25 when it comes out? Need something new!!!

@vimalverma123,Disappointed with new iPhone 16. Was expecting something special in hardware and design like fold etc but still retro design. No point of upgrading
@sabyasachee9044,"Smart people ask, What and how. Not telling you cause nothing changed."
@jaimeerobertswarz,"I like the iphone, but its been so stagnant, and never delivers. <br>My 14pro has the worst battery life, so I shut off 120HZ &amp; always on display. <br>So these “features” or “claims” of even 10 hour battery, better photos are never true. <br>The 16 series seems a-lot more promising as 60HZ has better battery anyways, and the base iphones needed a big boost to start justifying that price. <br><br>I am however torn, as I wish I could get a pixel and am locked into the apple eco system. I will most likely choose a base 16 instead of doing a battery replacement. <br><br>I think it’s fine they redid the camera layout, the lenses are bigger which is why they moved them back. The Pros however very disappointed. <br><br>People have been saying don’t upgrade for the past 4 years. But considering the regular 15 can take photos better in some situations than the 14Pro shows how the base iphone is catching up. <br><br>I feel now the 16 model is a better buy than the pro series. I could care less about the AI features, I just want all day battery, and better bluetooth range. <br><br>When it comes to the cameras I want them to look like what they took at the event. I see pixels nighttime photos, compared to the iphone and I cant take a picture of the moon lol. I still feel in the demos apple is using dslr cameras. <br><br>It reminds me of the XR. But that phone actually seemed to have take the best photos for me in recent memory over the 13 &amp; 14 line. With the 12/13 minis having better photo quality in my time with them. <br><br>I really just want whats promised again. So its hard to be like “oooh new iphone”. When the iphones seem to be hit or miss with whats promised. <br> <br>I also feel for the prices we are paying throw in a free year of 100GB cloud storage. Add a charger again. <br><br>Its actually making more carbon emissions when we buy new phones. Because they most likely will get shipped. You need a charger, screen protector, &amp; case. Then you go get them or order them. Leading to more materials, gas, and emissions produced. <br><br>Apple needs to stop being so stingy. You’re not helping the earth because you offset your add ons that should be included in the box. It just means your company is offsetting the footprint to someone else so yours can be lower."

Then on the other side they make only Pro Features. Why no gaming Center like the rog phone? It seems like they dont know where to to....<br><br>Samsung on the other hand push gaming Features and pro tools but it Feels less confuse. You can choose to install more gaming or/and pro tools whatever you need more. <br><br>Another big plus on android you can install beta/github apks while Apple need always a workaround to install ipa without Appstore. That make it less intressting for people to Code &quot;underground&quot; apps for Apple. On the other hand Apple got only 1 device that make it very easy to max out Performance while Android got 50 diffrent brands that accept all the same Code but you cant max it out or it will breake on some devices....

It would have been cool to see a 90 hz on the regular iPhone 16 I have an iPhone 13 mini that I&#39;m keeping and hoping next year to maybe upgrade tand that the wide camera gets upgraded also. The16 definitely look nice and if you have a 12 or older it&#39;s a definite upgrade but I think if you have the 13 or newer probably not worth it.
@eddy7985,"I still have my 12 pro max, I used to upgrade every year but for the last few years I just don&#39;t feel like i&#39;ve missed out on anything. I think i&#39;ll be waiting for the iphone 17."
@Cryptid71,I love how Apple brags how everything they do is innovative yet almost every feature they introduce every year is somewhat a copy of something Samsung or another Android phone has done. Action button you&#39;ve been able to do whatever you want with your power button on Samsung since like 2012...
@ThatRubenMM2,So when are people actually gonna be happy with a phone launch. Mu question for yall is: Why do you care if its good or not if you have no reason to buy it
@DerDop,Just another phone.
@NewPlayer_000.1-qr5wg,I love the fact that u r up-to-date 🎉🎉🎉
@melkdoesart,Let&#39;s be honest what iphone has been doing each new release is a simple quality of life Samsungs update that existed years back
@yusufateeb,<b>NAHHHH HE CALLED US A PEASANT 😭</b>
@soumyajitmohanty2386,I didnt watch the apple event just to see this review. Better than apple any day
@jjpracticingaloha,Maybe Apple will bring back finger print to replace the old camera button
@mungelomwaangasikateyo376,"Iphone updates: More colours, has a battery, can be recharged, can pause while recording (wtf Apple!)😂😂"
@_hellostranger_,"Yes it is evolving, just backwards."
@sxepantFTW,"The catch is only the main sensor is the only one on ip16 pro series to support 4K120 with 2x zoom😂😂😂 48MP UW is still rubbish, simply increase the pixel count without increasing pixel size, exactly like last year 12MP UW in Ip15 pro series"
@mardymarvin8441,well I for one like the photo button idea brings it more in line with how I would use my DSLR. Photos should be taken in landscape most of the time so the button layout seems like a sensible place.
@chiefbrownie,"Anyone who buys an iPhone is just getting screwed, year after year."
@husseindakroub5570,Man who cares about camera . The phone is the same phone . N people will still buy it
@himelpaul1053,"What is the game at  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=387"">6:27</a> ?"
@i.amvulcan8373,You need to tag team the battery test with someone else! No point in staying up for 27 hours alone!
@iMrParker,Crazy to me that Arun blasts Samsung for a lack of changes when Apple pulls this and he seems fairly satisfied
@AbugusGoosegus7333,Hi
@LittleNinjaXYBA,Do a if apple was honest video about the new phone!
@WalterJohnson-b2f,Lewis George Taylor Ruth Williams Shirley
@keyo1817,iPhone 11 cams are the original 2 cameras that look like the 16
@MonicaTheMad,I use my iPhone almost exclusively horizontally.
@ras4756,I don’t think he was impressed with the new iPhones 😂
@hselectrical8967,Big moment for the 7 people who owns the Apple Vision Pro 🎉😂 loved your analysis
@Chucky7286,I am seriously disappointed with iPhone batteries- generally anything done by Apple when it comes to battery. In all the years I have only used their products I now feel so discouraged and think they are very disloyal to their clients and are only interested in deliberately supplying sub par products at high prices so that clients can keep coming back
@AviationLolz,O wow the iphone 11 pro sorry i mea. 12 pro sorry 13 pro OMG IM DUM I MEAN 14  PRO NO 15 PRO DAM IT<br><br>bruh when are they gonna do somethign diffre nt. It toook then 5 generatiosn to make diffrent cameras and eve thepro still has that sane layput
@UltiMogr,"what is the point of an iphone review? with so loyal customers. people will buy it regardless if it is good or not. maybe they should launch a subscription service, where you can have every new model directly shipped out to you"
@Cinematicgaming101,iPhone 16 = iPhone 12 Design is back and also enhanced 🎉
@macroblockingone,Apple using Samsung s20 ultra displays I think
@JustaRandomguy0.0,All if not most who will get this will use them the exact same way how they&#39;ve used their iphone 11 and will be clueless about the tech inside the 16.
@melmokmo,"Sooo, iphone 16 pro got a Pokedex build in it to see what dog is in front of you."
@cristiano-w1n8v,But the iPhone 16 is no better than your bigger phone.🤌🏻✨
@thndercat1,I’m holding onto my iPhone 14 Pro 512 gb and my Ultra 1 watch as long as they can be updated
@wakanda0070,😂😂😂Apple Ai is underwhelming
@milantelman,Lol the iPhone cameras don&#39;t look like fidget spinners anymore.
@stevenstoyanov,I think the Main thing that people need to take away is that FROM NOW ON !!! there will be NO huge changes or innovations being made because we are in a stage where almost everything has been done and invented 🤷🏼‍♂️ and the phones are very advanced already so for people saying omg no innovation no nothing same old phone 📱 well yeah get used to it guys it’s not gonna start levitating or showing holograms 🔥 technology has its limits and the only thing left to do is remove the Dynamic Island and that’s it
@mxp8856,60 Hz is enough. Most people won&#39;t realize that. <b>slap</b> not on a smartphone that costs 900 dollars!
@richie694,Can’t believe you made a video on these minimal updates last so long
@sam.0901,Waiting for Pixel 9 pro XL and iPhone 16 pro max camera comparison
@JJGG1231,Great review! Thanks for not gushing over everything like some reviewers do. You were balanced and funny! 😂
@MindVsBody,Is it intentional to make this a 16 min ish video? 😊
@only_Anjani,Me: Excited for the IPhone event.<br>Apple: Why??
@stopmotionadventures4812,11 hours ahi
@Erbschlechter,"but, people, hear me out... WHY is Apple doing 60 hz in 2024? Are they out of their minds?"
@ye849,"Not true about the auto focus. I know a lot of people including myself that think it was insulting for such a basic and required feature not being on a phone marketed for photography. <br>Try using the auto focus to take pictures of the moon or a ship in the distance for instance. <br><br>Generally speaking, i think the entire event was extremely disappointing. <br>My ultra watch is at 79% battery health. I have to replace my iphone 15 pro max due to business reasons (i dont pay for it) <br><br>And still i will probably not buy the new ultra and seriously considering getting a parallel iphone 15 as both actually sound worse than their predecessors<br><br>Also, 90% of their new features introduced for iphone or the watch are pure software, and old one at that, you can do the eye sight thing on an iphone 10"
@iwondertv,What happens to the side bar button when you put it in a case?
@sippin1486,You all talking about this and that but still will run out and buy the phone 🤦. You guys always buy them so why complain at this point
@heyspookyboogie644,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=870"">14:30</a> wait, so after years of people complaining there was nothing “pro” about the pro phones, now it’s TOO pro focused?! wtf?!"
@timothymarchant,You have a posh accent from south england. But you say &quot;faster&quot; like a northerner.... are you just putting it on?
@rssagoo5780,I’m happy with my iPhone 11 Pro Max 🤣🤣🤣
@MK-qf3ve,my s9+ have better &quot;action button&quot; than iPhone 16 lol
@DrVimto,"apple could have just made 2 phones a year,, a normal and a pro.. also the pro they could have just done a one button on it, havin it multi use, like the camera button does..but instead they like to sell several different models.. i beleive they must be losing cash.."
@reymarortega7388,Iphone upgrade every year like baby step ...
@billymadeit,Yall are complaining about the iphone 16 as if you you wont buy it😂
@LSDdreams808,This new i phone makes android look even more out dated 😂😂😂
@MshnryMan,"Thank you for not being affected by Google&#39;s snubbing of your honest review. I do feel like this review would have been slightly biased if you were still using iPhone instead of the S24U, so I appreciate that you&#39;re in a good position to provide a fair and accurate criticism of their misses and an good summary of the things that have improved."
@Andy-xd7ng,the 16 P/PM screen has same 460 PPI and specs as the 15PM/16/15 at 1000 nits max brightness (typical); 1600 nits peak brightness (HDR); 2000 nits peak brightness (outdoor)... the big upgrade will be the 17PM
@muhammadadam2030,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=2"">0:02</a> another colored predecessor."
@masashiyeo,Looks like the pixel 9 pro XL is a way better option than this underwhelming overpriced nonsense 🤦‍♂️
@biis317,Should I upgrade from 12 pro max?
@peterw616,I love the way you see straight through apple BS! :)
@hnaqvi6656,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=487"">8:07</a> &quot;it&#39;s all been done&quot;<br><br>sums up every iPhone since iPhone 6"
@trailerworld4154,When are we getting ios 18 stable update ..?
@ZAIRGAS_HAVEN,"wait what was that Marques <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a>"
@seanh6127,I honestly was gonna get the new iPhone 16 pro max but they took away the blue color😭so I’ll keep my blue 15 pro max and see what the 17 does
@sanjaykhandekarcof4848,But how left handed people will use this new camera button
@Thr33Am,But why not give us a better front camera like the back
@BREEZ3_shorts,Nothing phone ahh camera layout
@Kgosiscringe,Iphone 16 needs 5 cameras get with the times(i am writing this on an 80$ phone)
@ramizahmadi7881,"the camera layout on the base 16 is &#39;Oh, we want a vertical camera setup but we can&#39;t do the box because people will just say its the same as the 12 so we&#39;ll remove the box entirely&#39;"
@simamkelemadikane,"Go to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=610"">10:10</a> for the part that talks about the Pro models"
@Melodiesimp,"so if  the new phones just get the previous model pro on a smaller screen with lower battery, that means buying a base model is useless"
@tinashegwekwe6585,like lets stop beating around the bush here this is an s24 ultra in an iphone case😂😂😂😂
@NabiL_Lam,I’m very disappointed that its 60Hz
@kishor_ryouta,I love the background of this video compared to the older videos.
@princeboateng694,Another easy skip this year
@DEANSKIN09,more crap
@angelaferkel7922,It has one benifit of atleast not having to buy the newest iphone because the last 3-4 iphones feel literally the SAME and cant tell them apart😂😂
@ajayshrestha100,&quot;seven people who own them&quot; 💀
@saifsgaming7863,WORST 😤
@theoneyoudontsee8315,i would think about 16 pro if only the rounded corners was smaller remember rounded corners are pixels cut from screen and less useful.
@108mtsan,"SAME IPHONE NOTHING NEW NO INNOVATION! APPLE SUCKS! Unless the new iPhone can time travel, transform into a car, or shoot bullets, it&#39;s the same iPhone year after year again! Just upgrade to an Android!"
@heyspookyboogie644,At least the action button works with gloves. Not so much with the camera button.
@banpreetathwal1074,i own an iphone myself but i am so jealous of people who have the s24 ultra. Apple is so late to the party. samsung is way ahead
@Drinkyoghurt,"Did they finally fix the ghosting issues caused by internal reflections with their cameras? This is one of the things that bothers me the most at this point with my iPhone 12, and they didn&#39;t really fix it in subsequent releases."
@Saint17Bricks,Does the camera button swiping feature work with a case on?
@cr5428,I cant wait !😂😂😂
@NotVoidly,"The base iphones, are last year&#39;s pros."
@spacemane_official,well the 16 pro 10 times opctical zoom where s24 ultra got 5 times
@cslee1981,"Iphone lost their creativity and innovative, please look at huawei what they produce despite sanction"
@CarsRumors,Sleep mode on action button
@jevanspam,u forgot u can pause videos on ios 18
@hhsoumya,I think innovation left apple since iphone x
@F91W,As an Apple fan i feel like i’ll stick to my 14 pro another year. At this point they’re just ripping us off.
@AC-lt5ro,🗣 Bring back home screen landscape mode!
@squirreltismw8295,S24 Ultra better ❤
@emanuelcastro5265,This will be the worse selling iPhone ever
@ade3193,Haha you’re definitely not getting an invite next year 😂
@abhay.uetube,It&#39;s not Apple intelligence it&#39;s rented from Google Apple intelligence
@PincoPallino-zh8wm,"To be fair, what else do you want to innovate. As of now, no one is reinventing anything. Samsung, Google, Apple, etc, they are more or less doing the same thing and keep giving you a &quot;new product&quot; for an extra $100-$200, while the average user (aka the 90% of the consumers) don&#39;t even make use of 50% of the tech that comes in one of those phones."
@RaghadAlabib,Is it just me or the iPhone 16 pro and pro max looks the exact same as the 15 and 14
@ohmygosh6176,"I can&#39;t hold an iPhone anymore because there are so many buttons. If Steve job were alive, he would have been furious."
@amazinc754,Bro I can&#39;t even tell the difference between this and the 15 atp
@MBAhrious,Me watching this knowing I&#39;m not getting it anytime soon.🥲
@rohitlohani07,Please make a battery performance video of all iPhone 16/Pro models
@eidamvolf5672,Samsung did this before Jesus
@WooHooCooCoo,It’s a damn MacBook Pro old Touch Bar…..o my goodness they just want the idea to work!😊
@pradipgc1565,Is that MKBHD?
@qurtmancini5539,"Be honest, they&#39;ve been the same since the iPhone 11"
@AseemChishti,Clean-up photo from unwanted people or stuff was in MI phones ages ago. 😂😂😂. Apple sure knows how to copy features
@maybe138,I like the new theme
@DSiri0039,Steve Jobs rolling in his grave right now seeing nothing has changed for the new iphones. Will be sticking with my 15 pro for a few years
@wanderingfool6312,"I’m watching the launch and being berated for wanting a new phone when nothing has changed, I’ve got an iPhone 11."
@bumpyfx4900,I though there would beat Huawei pura 70 ultra in reclaiming their spot has the best smart phone camera
@louistech112,Remember when ppl said we have holograms and stuff. Remember those old iPhones 5 renders with the laser keyboard lol
@devinegamingtv3427,"JerryRigEverything will take care of the screen testing, don&#39;t you worry about what tests they did :D"

@arvindxyogesh,Watching this in an iphone X gang
@innocentkunda,I feel the camera control button was just brought in to run from the fact that they have been giving the world the same iPhone design yet again for years now!
@littleropter420,I have an iphone 7
@LittleFoot27,Your using a fake iPhone though 🧐
@steakbraces4972,Tim did not cook this year
@AG-en5y,So innovative
@naitikka,No no and no… too less RAM… AI only US &amp; UK less like Europe not a thing… thanks from Finland. Really???
@Igor-sf1vb,still useless  garbade without micro sd slot. we will wait to 30+ version for get this option like we waited for real world usb connector and got incredible usb 2.0 version atleast.
@ULTGB1WW,Apple has 19.7 subs now 😬
@tipcentric,"One thing you missed about that new camera button... Like very many content creators, I film all my content vertical with the phone mounted in a clamp mount on a tripod. The new camera button sits right where most camera mounts hold the phone, so yeah, it makes it totally useless, and possibly will cause issues with the mount actually pressing down on the button. Hard pass from me on this years iPhone."
@remnant7remnant74,Very well explained.
@shekharrana4387,Everyone saying they didn’t change anything but what do you expect to be inside a new phone everything we need we have
@MichaelPenicka,I feel that it looks like a nothing phone 😂
@livelovelaugh2130,"I really love the way the sponsored content is done on these videos. Discreet, polite, relevant, void of aggression."
@syedadilahmed4435,I Love my OnePlus 12
@Axeiaa,I feel like we&#39;re heading into an era of:<br>Writer side: AI Composes email to look fancy by using elaborate phrasing that basically boils down to &#39;dress up&#39; language.<br>Reader side: AI summarises email <br><br>So we&#39;re wasting bandwidth and computing power on things no one ever reads whilst we could just send out summarised emails to begin with.
@EthelJung-j5w,I love how neutral toned this video was! He didn&#39;t obsessively gloat about the new features nor did he unnecessarily criticize them. One of the fairest reviews I&#39;ve ever seen on this channel
@shivnaytiwari2466,I see apple joining the queue behind Intel footsteps. Soon they are going to be a thing of the past.
@ZLaggo,Wow for once Mrwhosetheboss seems disappointed with apple <br><br>Wow
@malikabdulwahab1120,Now I know why Warren Buffett sold half of his share 😅
@OlavDutchYT,yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
@bluemoonbm3618,Same old shit again
@Samwarren1982,"we do a lot of PHD camera work… “Push here Dummy”. It’s Point and Shoot, so I agree, the extra stuff is irrelevant."
@aires69uk,I wonder if Apple put the iPhone in a wind tunnel and have reached the optimum design and it can&#39;t really go any further than that. I think what we really need is a a concept iPhone now.
@adiadd,Mr. Whosetheboss battery comparison is the vid we’re all waiting for honestly
@jbballares25,every year apple product is disapointed…
@GregorMcIntosh,Remember that it ws made from cobalt mine by child labor in Congo!

@anjeu67,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=869"">14:29</a> Exactly! Their pro models now really feel more exclusive to professionals."
@JoshuaOlujide,"Apple seems to be on this weird campaign to get people to shoot entire moves on their iPhones, which just feels bizarre. Like I agree that technically speaking all the Pro camera upgrades and features are technically very impressive, but the LARGE majority of people who are gonna buy the pro phones are just gonna get them for the telephoto camera (or just to say they have the most expensive latest iPhone) and literally never use those features. They just feel more and more niche every single year. Also even for people who are filmmakers that this would appeal to: would you WANT to do all this stuff on a phone screen? Feels like you&#39;d prefer the larger screen of a computer or tablet, a phone interface would feel cramped no matter what."
@Treborray,I was so hype for this phone for my tech channel. Now I’m thinking about adding android phones into the mix
@Bhampton444413,I would have upgraded if the 16 came with 120hz display. That’s the only feature I care about. I don’t care about cameras or AI. Unreal.
@limitless1919,So it&#39;s nothing new for 5 years straight
@lifeisshort3472,"yup, I am going to wait for Iphone 20"
@RIVvideos,You nailed it
@S.L.G-yt,Will you be doing a pixel 9 pro fold review?
@user-ud5lv3xs6t,We ordered buttonless. Tim cooked 2 new buttons
@LSnium,My 14 pro max is really cool.
@i_timo4,Watching all this iPhone 16 review videos know perfectly well that there’s no way I can make a $1000 to buy one😂
@mparada1799,Thank you Arun for finally providing a very honest iPhone first impressions review. Totally different than last year&#39;s iPhone review. Excellent job as always
@zai2173,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=382"">6:22</a> ok new iPhone is cool and all but what is that game"
@glamazoid,Tim Apple Oh Tim Apple...
@lll8112,I hope we can change the functionality of the capture button to other things. Like maybe I dunno… well I really don’t know what to do with that.
@jensgheysens2052,"I lve my s24 ultra, because you can do that with the S-pen :D"
@neverwastakenandwilleverwill,The bad part is that Apple got their revenge in terms of subscribers...

@tahahaider5836,Looks like a nothing phone
@widget347U,samsung &gt; iphone
@baronofgreymatter14,"So, Like the Sony Xperia 4k120"
@Dargmato,ok so hear me out they are literally giving a18 in the entry level meaning they are challenging samsung to do it better so ig aaron i think we might see no exynos this year also am not apple fan neither samsung but samsung or androids have more function customization and had ai sinse 2022 or 2023
@ktdfc,The phones look cheap
@juleo1195,OnePlus 9 Pro could also do 4k @120 and it was releases in 2021........

@Cordy49,"i&#39;ve had siri do something similar before, I was at home and it was like 11pm and I asked siri to pause my music and it almost called my manager"
@andrewcaban1910,Well I’m on the Iphone 12 pro max so I might just get this one.
@MrQuacksGaming,"more and more people are trying to become influencers. My mom has her own business paring with amazon, shaws, and smaller companies like the paper store. she swapped out her cannon camera, for her iPhone 15 pro max when it came out. this is a huge upgrade for the fam business! tysm apple :)"
@joeycorrea601,I have a 15 pro max and I don’t understand the hate for the placement of the action button. I don’t even have huge hands and it’s in a pretty accessible spot IMO
@rforey,100% thought the same thing. The Pros are getting so Pro they’re becoming niche. I’m not a videographer so the fact they can shoot actual movies is irrelevant to me!
@mintusaren895,Stylidh way of imprisonment
@rafuri_1,Hardly any changes
@kevincarsales,You bash google for product before feature and  let apple skate?? Dude how much do they pay you
@theviralstuff4460,Whete is 16 oro max

@Chewbacca0678,"It’s the “apple intelligence” phone generation, yet, “apple intelligence” won’t be available at launch. It will trickle down piece by piece over the next software updates. Might as well wait for next year when it’s actually going to be available (and stable)."
@PaulFCB1899,"Seriously, the new camera configuration for 16 is the better variant, back when X/XS were the standard the cameras were much smaller so it’s easier to fit them like on the 13-15. These phones are for people who want to take instagram pics and post on other social media stuff, not power users, they focus almost entirely on that market for these basic models."

@parthsingh9653,Actually it’s still for professional but what about Samsung 😂
@jamrockccccc,I&#39;ll never buy another iPhone !
@xavierpierre1676,i wish they brought back the thumb print with the button because then it can open the phone as well as use the camera i get the security issues with finger print but yea
@Sariann1211,Not me sitting here watching this on a 13 pro.
@mahmed3847,I&#39;m not an iphone user but I think 16 pro max is actually very good ❤
@v3x186,I rather keep my iphone 10 for now
@ThunderClark,The best thing about this is the 15 is now 100$ cheaper
@dolphdr,I guess they don&#39;t let you say AI and you have to say Apple Intelligence each time... I hope AI (🍎🧠) will be good enough one day to change the video audio so it can just say what it is &quot;AI&quot; 😬
@SujeetKumar-jk6ci,And this video length is also 16 😂

@TheAbzAyy,Is it worth upgrading from a 14 Plus to a 16 Pro Max?
@dianamagritte5079,Ugh no. Terrible! Only improvement was that the colors on the phones actually look like colors and not washed out pigments in the material.
@xenomorphgourmet1005,"Woah, apple has Google Lens. How long has Google Lens been around?"
@SirTaklob,Feels like my upgrade will be the Samsung S25 Ultra.

@sakil06,Bezel’s are impressively thin looking awesome
@Faraz-cse,The only thing good iPhone 16 has done is<br>That camera button.<br>A18 processor (instead of giving 1 year old like in iPhone 15)<br>Apple intelligence even in base model
@dura2k,"The &quot;turning point moment&quot; is not for that many iPhones, because Apple Intelligence is only in English and not in the EU (and China?)."
@nuyou21,"He wanted more features, but now that Apple&#39;s given more features, there&#39;s too many. He&#39;s totally lost the plot, as talk about waffling on over so-called meaningful points... all 2 of them. 🤭🤣🤦‍♂"

@Orca774,Arun matched the energy perfectly in this video 😂

@j.r.6784,"A video about buttons! Good work, Apple!"
@durzoblint6,without even watching. 80% of this video is about &#39;new&#39; cameras isnt it?
@Kinzzo,The 17 I just know it will have the cameras like the 7 &amp; 8 puls 😂
@martarandla2604,I don&#39;t think apple is really trying anymore because people will still buy anything they advertise without thinking twice
@Satoru_Gojo-v,So what’s new?<br><br>Apple: the camera changed position
@fahim5254,Background 🔥
@taulantbeqiraj1,"Here&#39;s to the Snobiest YouTuber on the market, decided to not give 2 videos(Impressions and Review) to any phone company, but each time an iPhone comes out, that principle vanishes😄"
@Deltic07,"I must say, this review is a breath of fresh air. So rare is it to find someone who cuts through the usual Apple hype and gives it to you straight. So many reviewers are besotted by every little so-called &#39;innovation&#39; or &#39;invention,&#39; which are often just recycled ideas with a shiny new label. Apple history is like Hollywood history—it&#39;s whatever they want it to be, and some tech reviewers seem more than happy to ignore this. But this review? It’s real, grounded, and refreshingly honest. Kudos for keeping it that way.<br><br>I did watch the keynote, but honestly, it was as boring as Google’s last one. I can’t be sitting through this stuff anymore. They used to be exciting, but now? Just meh. I really do wonder how Apple or Google still manage to keep millennials interested these days."
@SamB_Fernandes,For now I’m good with my iPhone 13
@AbdulahiOmarSugule,For me hello Samsung 😅

@jckaz91,Yes Siri is kind of an idiot... you can&#39;t even have fun with it anymore. I remember when you could ask it where to bury a dead body. The other day I asked a simple math question and it called my boss..... and we all know how slow Siri is at showing what it did so it got a couple rings in before I could cancel the call.  Plus voice to text is the worst thing ever. I feel like I could type things faster than I am editing everything that it hears me say. It tries to correct me in a different way and it always fails. Like if this comment is typed in any weird manner it&#39;s because I&#39;m using voice to text. my wife likes to make fun of my grammar on texts and Facebook posts and it&#39;s always crappy voice to text..... sometimes I have to wait a good five seconds before it finally corrects to what I said versus what it wants me to say.
@edoardocherubin6783,It makes me laugh that at the begining of this year I bought a new gaming pc for 800€ that can do everything (The last one I had was ~15 years old)… And now there is an iphone at double the price that… Is basically the same iphone for the last 4/5 models. Just a little bigger<br>At the same price like lasts models<br>And I say it as an iphone user (I have the 11 pro max with ios 16 lol)
@ZoliRza,It’s the SAAAAAAME PHONE!!!
@Enrico-vc6qx,I love how the video on the iphone 16 is 16 minutes long
@userMB1,"Apple desperately trying to appropriate the abbreviation AI with Apple Intelligence. However, if you&#39;re going to do that, you need to make it better than real AI.

Forget it. I&#39;ll stick to Android devices. I&#39;ll consideran IPAD PRO or one of their computers when the time comes but F**k Apple&#39;s phones &amp; accessories man. They&#39;re Literally a &quot;Daylight Robbery company&quot; that takes advantagen of their customers ignorances whilst pretending to treat people like they&#39;re &quot;exclusive&quot; JUST BECAUSE they&#39;re in Apple&#39;s teeny tiny garden, whilst Android&#39;s &quot;Garden&quot; is THE REST OF THE PLANET."

@rickatan,For me I take car videos and I usually hold my phone upside down to get a better shot.. shot that camera button is perfect cause im already use to using the phone in that position
@christophersokolowski,"airpod max have always had an H1 chip in each headphone, rather than one H2 chip and microprocessors for communication in the pro, so perhaps the H2 in each headphone cup is redundant or just unnecessary level of processing power in the airpod max that handles its workload fine with the dual H1 chips"

@shahilgohil4176,What was game name you playing?
@theguyfromwalgreens,So no real improvement to the Pro  that it now has a 5x ultra wide camera?  I’m curious when they’ll take a chance and add more cameras like that Galaxy model has.
@AbhishekSrivastava_ab,There is nothing wow about the new Apple products anymore. There is hardly any innovation going on in Apple now. Post Steve Jobs there&#39;s hardly any industry leading innovation or features they have been able to achieve. Sad 😮‍💨
@Allthephones,#3 on trending is legit amazing.but i dont like it i like your iphonee pro ultra ultra

@southernpanda33,I’m still on my iPhone 14 Pro Max and don’t see a reason to upgrade yet.
@Carter_Bourne,Check out my reaction to the apple event I roasted apple it is insulting how they treat people thinking a new camera is the way to go after 10 phones
@YoRealSpin,LUCKY BRO
@Slick70-h1x,Am still rocking my XR
@xkraken6130,The camera button would be great if they have integrated it with power button or volume button
@caliado,The camera button is meant to be really manipulated in landscape mode not portrait
@3X3Beastsu,"Xperia Pro usually offers better features for professionals, but it seems iPhone 16 will be a little bit more alluring in terms of ease of use, accessibility and speed."

@INDIANBEA5T,It&#39;s literally no better than the older ones. Apple being apple.
@thomasdurr5586,"As I already wrote in another comment, maybe it&#39;s time that the tech companys bring out only all 2 years new phones, watches etc. So there is more WOW from the customers. AND Apple come quick closer to the 2030 target. It is a joke, 60Hz refresh rate in a 849.00 swiss francs device?!?! And WOW, USB-C for charging the normal AirPods. By the way Honor and Samsung are not far away to present the first trifold devices. But it is al about money I think."

@thinkcontent442,Iphone 16 is basically iphone 12 and iphone 15 merged together
@nathanchapel5950,So my thought on the new camera button is I think I’m going to love it. I have really small man hands and I cannot even reach the circle with my thumb when trying to take the selfie without feeling like I’m going to drop the phone. So this is going to be perfect for my thumb

@Alec15,Apple:<br><br>Where are always two steps behind
@TheJklay,£900 for 60hz in 2024 is a rip off
@L1ven,60hz?? 1000€ device?? What kinda joke is this :D You get 120hz AMOLED display in 300e Androids but not in 1000e Iphone :--D What kinda excuse they have for this?
@Leep18200,No innovation as usual lol. I have a IPhone 12 Pro Max and I plan on using it until Apple doesn’t support the phone anymore.
@LordGatitoOfficial,i got an ad with mrwhostheboss presenting it while watching his video 😔
@user-is1jm7hd3h,Apple is such a boring company! Look at Google pixel... you will notice a difference in design and functionality

@NihilityRogue,"I really like these AI features but unfortunately, Europe and China won&#39;t be getting them :( I&#39;m still gonna get the iPhone 16 Pro Max for the larger screen and better gaming performance."
@Jaden7Yugi,We can call this years apple event apple 2024 remastered.. Many same old stuff presented as if they are new gens..
@EmulatorMode,Omg Infinity Nikki game on iphone 😍
@Sassyglbeauty,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=459"">7:39</a> ok. This might just be the feature that makes it worth buying this gen phone. Right now, I keep my notifications off all day and only allow my favorites to break through at anytime. This means, I miss a lot of text messages."
@ITSDOGE,"Honestly, the iPhone 16 is a decent price but still a little expensive"
@sumanthd02,i feel like they have added so many functionalities to the capture button that it might be easier to do with touching the screen itself. I might be wrong tho
@TheElementSwing,60hz lmao
@Dionyzos,"Soo, the 15 Pro is the iPhone to get. You get the all the AI features , 120Hz, and only miss out on the pointless new button."
@0000_official,wow
@Corrupted__User_0,I’m an apple fan no question but this year is just disappointing.. there is literally no improvements other than the camera
@bigsmoke279,Anyone else plan on keeping their current iPhone lol
@alfredrimorin2083,"At this point apple is really stuck with their iPhones. Disregarding the competitors, they cannot go beyond the iPhone 12 itirations. New chip, better cameras, bigger screen..."
@pedrodscom,"Puff youtube recommends you again, your reviews are like you are disappointed or everything is not enough all the time, even for the positive things. <br>That view from moral superiority that you could have done better is already out of fashion.

@fmlmobilelegend9723,No other phone can fight with apple for prefection on software yea yea they all ready been for decades on android but not smooth as apple....but still i prefer android usability 😅
@Thethewho,I liked the boxier camera design and I&#39;m an android user😂
@kuaqimai,Camera button exist on Sony phone many year back
@anonym45,"nah, I&#39;ll wait for next year"
@AhmadEdinHodzic,Apple lost me with their white screens of death happening to many people i know many of them switched to Samsung.
@deepakjoy2615,If the camera button was below the volume rockers on the left side ....it would have made it ergonomically better
@Trading-p3v,His face says everything.
@Amelia-v4u,"Apple has just converted me with this year&#39;s upgrades. All the new features, the miriads of software and hardware upgrades, the groundbreaking, new ideas and solutions. All this combined with a state-of-art display and reasonable pricing. I just can&#39;t resist to make the switch finally. Samsung S series, here I come!"
@gersongarcia4518,"I would rather still fix my iPhone 12 , why buy the 13,14,15,16 nothing new here for us"
@nursafa1595,waiting for the S24U vs 16PM camera comp..
@nicco1295,That vision pro comment 🔥
@AverageSensei,They took the copy paste meme too serious 💀
@deadringer-cultofdeathratt8813,When I bought the 12 pro max I was 100% sure that the 16 would be the refresh year… guess I’ll keep waiting. It would be a shame if u bought the 16 and then the 17 is the one with the updated design and proper fast charging.
@JTZE-J,"Wait, new background setup??"
@savageazazel,2024 and 1000$ phone is 60hz is just crazy. Even Xiaomi make 90hz screens for their 100$ phones
@thesmileaple8139,"Bro stared recording mkbhd at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=778"">12:58</a>"
@davidareyouhuman,I’m excited to switch over to Samsung or Google after my 15ProMax gives up on me or need to upgrade!
@XeqtrM1,I don&#39;t think people will upgrade until a Base iphone gets 120 Hz so that will probably be iphone 17 so next year plus majority of people don&#39;t care about Ai stuff I will get iphone 16 pro tho since I haven&#39;t own a iphone since iphone x
@arz3313,Apple be copying nothing phones💀
@squish06,Will Apple intelligence exist in the eu?

@TR4008,I think companies should no longer release phones every year .<br>The cycle should now be one new model every 2 or 3 years.
@mr.e7005,"At this point, if all they&#39;re doing is improving the camera, just move out the phone industry and move into the camera and photography industry. Be honest who gets an iPhone for performance spec wise"

@ronbrooks6547,The Battery on the Iphone 16 Pro Max is supposed to last 2 hours longer than the Iphone 15 Pro Max. Another reason to Upgrade
@BenSabersTV,Omg it looks like all the other versions! Dont get me wrong im just as sick of all samsungs looking the same. Apple and samsung are both stuck in a rut. Ive now moved to the honor magic v3 thats truly innovative
@bobdepinguin,Hy dear Arun im very sorry to have to tell you this but apple beat you back in the subs battle 😭

@MJG70,"Apple is in big trouble!  60 HZ on the iPhone 16 base model. Only 8GB of ram on their top Flagship. This is simply not enough to accomplish their Ai goals. In addition, you are about to get millions of pissed off customers that can&#39;t take advantage of Apple Intelligence, unless you buy the new iPhones.  No iPhone under 15 pro, can use the Ai features. FORCING customers to buy a new phone. WOW!  SCUM BAGS. All because they cheated their customers for years with 4-6GB of Ram"

@ronbrooks6547,"I have to admit I&#39;m upgrading just for the New Shutter Camera button &amp; larger 16 Pro Max Screen and the Dessert Color. And my Main Phone is the Samsung Z Fold 6. One phone is a Entertainment Beast &amp; the other is great for IMessage, FaceTime, and Apple TV. And Family members prefer IMessage. Time Samsung And Apple upgrade the Message apps. Need better colors and Designs. Its 2024 soon to be 2025"
@DeaconSmithGames,As a photographer there’s been many times where I want to manually focus or change the aperture and shutter speed so I see the camera button as a big win and most people use cameras these days so I think more than 2% will use it I think nearer to 20-50%
@XYZ1234-z9o,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=777"">12:57</a> MKBHD sighting 👀"
@SmurfandTurf97,Apple running out of ideas 💡 just adding buttons now. 3 years later Apple will get rid of it. 😂
@monster3358,Unbelievable colour is iPhone 15 🖤👑
@kycdoe,"One quick comment trying to be objective here:  I understand why you are always comparing brands and phones - kinda of your thing - but you should look at all these features from an iPhone user not if the feature exist on the market before. From this point of view it WILL change things and massively, something other phones CANNOT do. Also Ecosystem and Security will always be year light ahead of other companies. Which are the reasons why people use it. Reason why these new features should come from the point of view of someone just getting them and incorporating them into their workflow."
@OwenDavies83,4k@120hz on a 128gb phone. 😅
@kasayofarm1383,Well done 👏 ❤
@Aaron-is9xo,"I only buy a new iphone when I have too. All people want is more and more, I don’t get the upgrading every year. I mean how much more can they put on these phones."

@sense.reginald,i&#39;m an android user but i&#39;m still gonna watch this anyway 💀💀💀
@carternll,another key thing is the fact that iphone 15 pros already have all of these features.. so don’t waste your money.
@mirzamustafa9127,“Big moment for the 7 people that own an Apple Vision Pro” <br><br>nah he didn&#39;t say that. lol

@garvpatel3649,Does it still have a 60 hz refresh rate ?
@Steve-f4p,"Apple is a big scam ,especially in N.America"
@lobstershrimp,Copy and paste. Rinse and repeat. Apple.
@a_robloxfurry,so the “new” iPhone 16 is basically an iPhone 15 with a new exterior 😂
@lbpdluis,looks exactly like the previous one
@YousafAliMalik,camera still not better than xs max + apple will make it powerful intelligent but never change the shape like iphone 14 pro max
@yatinmulik,"Is the new camera button just a way to make people get use to a side button, so that they can quietly bring back touch ID?"
@CasualViewer-t4f,Here is hoping game devs can leverage that camera button…
@AbhishekKumar-yq5kp,I do use focus often.
@NicHowell-h6l,Wouldn’t anything from the X-12  series be capable of this spatial video recording given their logic of camera sensor placement???? Kind of genuinely curious what all has been improved in image processing to make this a modern only model feature
@TheBaldDan,Meanwhile samsung users 😒&quot;new features&quot;

@Shadow39X,"One day they will let me have a transparent dock, or more than 4 icons at the bottom. Just wait till we see that innovation haha"
@ILazarakos,Buying an iPhone every year is the same as buying Call of duty every year
@H0ney3ee009,It&#39;s basically an iPhone 15.5 without Apple Intelligence at launch. Only shows how late Apple is with AI.
@Faith_Driv3n,So basically it&#39;s nothing really innovative 😂 I left the 15 pro max for a Z fold 6 and realized how outdated apple is and I thought the 16 might make me reconsider but I guess not

@adamknight5089,"So sick of this, all the emphasis is just on camera and video, it&#39;s a telephone, just focus on that"
@jlsajulan,If they keep the camera and buttons the same then there will be a dip in 3rd party case sales.

@martingifford5415,Feels like paying a lot extra for features I&#39;ll never use.

@staciefreshener4032,"I will be honest , I&#39;m really bored the whole time ... And that says a lot. This phone is better than iphone 15 lineup but it&#39;s not that good it feels like a upgrade. If you have Iphone X then also you will feel this is like 50% or 60% better or more . That is nice , but slowly 12 ,13 and you have less reasons to update. I mean it&#39;s for mirror selfie to show the logo anyways , why not focus on reducing glare from flashlight."
@MaddisonCann,I have an iPhone 11 and I&#39;m not upgrading until apple gives me a pink PRO
@shreeharikeloth6647,Meanwhile HUAWEI introduced MATE XT With a triple fold. It&#39;s high time Apple did something drastic to keep its brand name .its  really boring to see the way Apple is moving forward Wake up APPLE...you can do better ......

@danish3249,Where is Ai😅😂
@Ed-xb2sz,feels like they are sticking to the &quot;tick-tock&quot; upgrade cycles of old but as the phones get a new name every year the incremental upgrade feels cheap. e.g. this is obviously an iPhone 15S
@MeganBelton1,"I just bought a case from Burga, so now I have to get the new phone 🤭"
@supero69,I&#39;m ttrading my iphone 15 for iphone 16 pro because I wasn&#39;t satisfied with iphone 15 only had it for 7 months I was bored with Galaxy phones. Beside I choose between iphone or galaxy phone because only brands are available in South Korea
@NELLYB,Its a lame upgrade with even lamer marketing. The promo for it was even janky. I wanted to upgrade my partners phone but no 120hz on the regular $800 phone? Not even 90hz?? Im gonna surprise her with a samsung and she&#39;ll thank me before the year is over

@mandalaqueen828,Does this camera bleach our skin in photos too like some of the other iPhones ? I don’t know if I should just switch to android again
@1asian1phone,"Just think how cumbersome it will be to use that new camera button with a case on, especially with those who like to use bulky cases. Case manufacturers are going to have to build a pretty big cut out for your fat fingers to use it properly. I don&#39;t understand adding buttons when you can do everything on the screen that&#39;s in front of you."

@maddoxtodd6,"I know it’s not a huge difference between the 15 pro max, but I think the upgrade is a little worth it for me (I have the iPhone 11)"
@CuriouslyContent,‘Feels like the new features on the pro phone are more made for industry than point and shoot’ <br><br>I believe thats what the ‘pro’ is all about in the name. They then take the feature(s) that are most applicable to the masses (like an action button) and bring it down to the regular phone.

@eusaveyou,IMHO that camera button is annoying tbh.
@heyguycalculator415,"&quot;Dear Sir, I would like to inquire...&quot; best quote from Mr. Whosetheboss himself."
@physics77guy,"the funny part is that majority of iphone users are casual users (majority teenagers and other demographic) and making things this complex in terms of camera, is only going to cater to very few users.... it looks like apple is going down blackberry route where they tried to give corporate security based phones to regular users....."
@android-ud2nf,I’m more excited about the reviews than actually buying the phone. My iPhone is currently 2 years old and broken and I’m ok with it weirdly enough. I just don’t want the same phone again. The 14 pro max I have felt too similar to the 11 pro max I had and I only replaced the 11 pro max cuz I shattered the back panel but after getting the 14 pro max I remember wishing I would have been ok just never taking the case off and keeping the broken phone for another year or two. We are in a nasty cycle of repurchasing the same product with slightly tweaked specs every year
@ravenscot6072,Bottom line if u have at least 14 and below it is worth it upgrade otherwise nope ..
@jrbionic404,I would love for Do Not Disturb to not show even a single notification on the lock screen. It annoying to go into Do Not Disturb and still see who is texting me and on which apps are receiving notifications. Defeats the purpose.

@Ruby_Mullz,"The action button is amazing for accessibility! I’m still on a 14 Pro Max, but if I upgrade the thought of clicking it once to turn on voiceover is great! I always have to get a pro max since I need the biggest screen possibke, but the camera options button is dumb. Everybody uses a case, which will mess with the pressure used to push it, and u can’t swipe it unless it’s iunsealed in the case."
@sk2sk2-uv5zl,nice lol.. idk what to say xd
@alanv3185,Still on the iPhone 12. Not upgrading till they get rid of the island/notch and the camera bump. Last phone before this was the iPhone 6 so you know I&#39;m not bluffing

@andrewdavidson665,"I&#39;m one of those 4 year people (12 pro max users represent!) but Apple Intelligence is a reason not to bother upgrading for me because I do not want machine learning gimmickry thrown in my face. The sensible ML stuff like used for photography sure, but cowboy frogs and rewriting my own text? No thanks. <br><br>Apart from that I think I&#39;ll just be keeping my 12PM until its battery dies (still at 85% after 4 years... not bad) and then will decide on doing a battery upgrade or getting a 14 or 15 of some type. <br><br>This to be fair is not a diss on the upgrades of the phones because they are incrementally technically obviously getting better each year but the time of the huge leaps from iteration to iteration are gone and thus far my 12PM is still doing the job it needs to do for me."

@josecanciani,"Good takes. I&#39;m confused about your words on the many perks the cam now has. You have always given the &quot;fun&quot; category to Android phones and expressed how &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;boring&quot; the iPhone is. But now that there are so many things you seem to be complaining about how the normal user who will never use them. If all these bells and whistles are not making the lives of these normal users more complicated, it shouldn&#39;t be something to worry about. If you don&#39;t use the new button, everything seems to be working as it ever worked, so this is a non-issue. Thoughts?"
@MiegmaishMenas,So will we get the new AI features and upgraded Siri in Europe and UK at all?

@100nakpvp2,Cannot wait to see what A18 Pro and 12% larger main sensor can do in low light video. I think that in 2 generations we could perhaps be at the point of diminishing returns of video quality same as we&#39;re now for photo quality.
@Sasuke_Car,Since the features come later and the phones are kinda the same shouldnt I just get 15 pro max ?
@NamanOG,Maybe the real 120Hz was the friends we made along the way

@paulgood2218,Another phone getting bigger and bigger and no thank you . They seem to be just improving on things that was all ready good so would you even notice in everyday use? I get it if you was upgrading from a 12 to a 16. But for every one else why would you upgrade ?
@mcgeedarion,The iPhone 16 Pro has nearly the same specs as my S23 FE. That’s crazy!
@mavishenator123,So does that mean that iPhone 11 or ones with in line cameras can capture spatial capture?

@DaFonse-l6o,"I need to critique something said on this video. The pro and the pro max are made for certain people in mind, it’s not made for the regular joe, so saying that the pro and pro max have features that the regular user don’t need is the dumbest thing anyone can say as the pro and pro max are not for the regular joe and that’s why there’s an iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 plus. Now that regular users do buy the pro and the pro max? Yes they do but they do so as a way to tout that they have something of higher price and not because they need the features on those phones. So please retract that statement as the pro and the pro max is not meant for regular users and thus why they have features that one, like you, may say why?"

@westmcgee9320,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=102"">1:42</a> I want to push back at this chuckle, but even as a daily AVP user, I think it’s shortsighted of Apple not to have announced the kind of glasses-free 3D solutions that exist at this size and which I’m using in my iPhone right now. <br>Basically, they’ve set up a way to capture 3D on the phone but not a way to view 3D on the phone.  <br>If the AVP weren’t so pricey, it might make more sense for them to call that the 3D viewing solution. <br>But it is.  <br><br>(For anyone wondering, the screen protector I’m using works with a company’s software to provide 3D viewing options to the user via eye tracking or even with that turned off. I assume it’s similar to the 3DS’ tech but I’m not a 3DS owner.)"
@smittyvanjagermanjenson182,Both apple and samsung havent innovatived in a decaded.
@brad7957,"Yeah, this year i&#39;m going back to Android. Apple&#39;s hardware and OS are great but nowhere near worth what they cost. I don&#39;t want to use half of these features - in fact I&#39;d rather have a dumb phone. Good luck to the next generation if they can&#39;t even read/write an email without AI."
@rinas6550,"I really like the desert titanium colour however that annoys me bc I know that when the next iPhone comes out it won’t have a nice colour and that’s when I’ll be due for an update 😂 it seems like the cycle the colours each year, one year super boring and one year with one unique pretty colour. I got the natural titanium 15 pro and uh…. Yeah……./."

I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one skeptical about this new and bold term. Given Siri&#39;s history, it&#39;ll take a lot to erase all the jokes about her &#39;brain-dead&#39; persona. 👩‍🔧"
@camptube7621,"My next upgrade will be from 15 pro max to 16 plus. Can’t go backward on screen size now. The 16 pro now has too much stuff I will never use. For casual people like me, I don’t think I’ll be alone. I think pro sales will go downward now."
@Chimmy_chucles,Samsung seeing this might make samsung boost up the s25 ultra to the point they have given it 8k 60 video resolution ability😂😂
@adamspencer6666,The extra buttons just look useless and more buttons that’ll get accidentally pressed!  I hated and still hate to this day the placement of the lock button. Tell me how often you take a screenshot when you just grab your phone
@Myst.Riddles,I&#39;m not an apple fan but<br>When you&#39;ve degree in Economics and comment on Processors A16 to A18😂<br>They design their own Processors A18 is a 3nm tech.<br>You don&#39;t even how much energy it saves and gives you more performance.<br>And how much effort they put into it .<br>It just blows one&#39;s mind out who knows what&#39;s inside of it really is.

I think Steve Jobs must be spinning in his grave like a lathe.<br><br>Fourth, it&#39;s a convenience feature, and a very minor convenience at that (for casual users). We&#39;ve been taking pictures with smartphones for over a decade using the screen controls; this behavior is so ingrained that the convenience of the Capture button seems superfluous."

@Danny7305,"what bugs me the most with iphone release responses is the general person will complain is a minor upgrade or its been done before, for one the days of grading yearly are long gone and if people are still upgrading yearly they have more money than sense and secondly the tech world copies each other all the time, apples approach has always been not to be first but to do the best, be happy  with what you have and move on, the fanboy comments putting any device or preference down is old and boring.<br><br>I&#39;m personally on a 3 year upgrade cycle, going from 13 pro max to 16 pro max this time, and tbh i probably could go another year if i wanted to <br>its not like the iphone 4 to iphone 4s/5 era when the upgrades where massive, or even the iphone X, where it was probably worth doing every other year<br>the way things are now you should be using your phones for years before considering upgrades to make it worthwhile"

@matarg99,"I&#39;ve been an iPhone user since the first one (2G) back in 2007. Historically, the iPhone was characterized by being at the forefront, with innovations and an attractive design to complement it. I&#39;m not saying it was the best, it was simply a very good phone, sometimes ahead of the competition, sometimes behind. I&#39;ve noticed that in recent years it&#39;s been falling behind the competition by at least 3 years. AI only on +2023 phones and only in English? It seems like they&#39;re limiting themselves to copying the competition, and with quite a delay (Visual Intelligence like Google Lens...). Better cameras and more speed are welcome, but it&#39;s not enough. In terms of design, it&#39;s been the same since the iPhone 12... Honestly, there&#39;s nothing motivating me to upgrade. I&#39;ll wait until they have 12GB RAM someday, it&#39;s incredible that the top model 16 PRO only has 8GB in 2024... Otherwise, it might be time to switch to Android after almost 20 years of using iPhone!"

@lopesmorrenofim,The only thing preventing me from upgrading from my 12 Pro is the price. The 16 Pro starting at 128GB makes it way too expensive to get the 512GB version. Guess I&#39;ll keep the 12 Pro another year.

A 6.7 in display and a phone that gets almost 2 days of battery life a year ago. There is no excuse to have specs that low in flagship phones this price."

But the Software conference was all &quot;You can change the color of your apps,&quot; and this one &quot;we added a new button.&quot; Like buddy, please. I can remap all the buttons on my Samsung. <br><br>If I could switch to Android after using Apple since the 3GS, I&#39;m sure others are as well. <br><br>--<br><br>And you know what? There&#39;s one big innovation that I feel should be easy, but Apple isn&#39;t doing. I want the goddamn Apple Pencil to work on an iPhone. What&#39;s the point of having a 7 inch display if I can&#39;t draw on it?<br><br>Maybe if Apple gets beat up enough they&#39;ll let us have laptop features on the iPad.

Please dont be a brand worshiper little teenage girl and change your old phone.

@Akarohm,"I feel like the camera button is actually an upgrade. So many apps just change volume when pressing the volume buttons (like snapchat) so a dedicated camera button would be very nice there. The 48mp ultra wide is also really nice since ultrawide is not very usable in lowlight. I do feel like the other camera button functions (besides zoom) will only be used by a very specific crowd, but still nice they did put it in. <br><br>I do feel like good cases will be even more hard to find considering the official cases from apple have a capacitive layer for the camera button. Even after a few years of magsafe cases there is still so much inconsistency with magnet strength that it took me like 6 cases from different brands before finding one that actually held the wallet securely lol. Shame they are only offering silicone cases, they suck and only last 3 weeks (if you’re lucky). Please bring back the official leather cases, those were really nice…<br><br>Shame Apple Intelligence is only available in English. Most of the features seem very fun to use but will most likely be unavailable for me for the next 3-5 years 😅. <br><br>All in all a mixed bag lol. But I would love that camera button and upgraded main+ultrawide camera’s. Apple intelligence would be nice too but I won’t hold my breath on it."

@dearickangelonej.legaspi6686,I&#39;m not joking withoit looking at the spec sheet I would not be able to see the difference between the Iphone 16 and the 12
@Diegomir7,I want mini!
@021Richoo,"I have the 14 , I will be getting the 16, 18, and 20. I’m Batman"
@IdleApple,"well, i can tell some difference between this and the 15"
@imsameasyoubutbetter680,camera control &amp; action button should be in one button
@alexisdilone6757,You should work for Samsung. You Really hate apple. And I get it I don&#39;t know why people expect for Apple to do a big change every year
@jadzahnan,"Not having apple intelligence in Europe ( or china), nor having a probable date for it makes this iPhone upgrade obsolete outside the US unfortunately. We got used to apple not having every option outside the US( like apple card) but for it to involve AI, the main playmaker of this generation of phones, is a big marketing mishap"
@shadmanahmed7874,Sticking to my 13 pro this year again
@NepseKundali,Instead of adding the button they should have just released a Apple camera 🤦🏻🤷🏻😂😂bruh
@TheTruthScribbler,Its the ugliest ! Not good at all! The base models are worth it! <br>That expression &quot;The best iPhone yet&quot; seemed crazy 🤪
@OPSYEDASJAD,"Should&#39;ve talked about the Congo genocide because of the iPhone 16😂 No? Ooh, that&#39;s okay"
@daboss2138,iPhone is just like FIFA or EA FC - same thing different year
@filipthe2,Apple AI is just copying samsung...
@TwinTurboOnly,This dude act&#39;s like a new phone model is supposed to suck him up or something. Crying about everything lol. Almost all phones are the exact same thing lets be real.
@caps741,"I think you made a good point at the beginning. A large number of people keep their phones for 3+ years. If someone has a 15, little to no reason to upgrade. XR, 11, 12, bit different. I have a 12 pro, and the regular 16 is a pretty large upgrade. No promotion display, which is disappointing since flagships have had that as a standard for years now, but the rest is significantly better. Do feel they could’ve still added the always on display to the base model."
@ryanizanami4866,&quot;Thoughts and Prayers&quot; for you 😹✨🔥
@realmrpanda,Good Work bringing the video on time
@naturalmosaic,He said “It feels like the pro phones are less geared to the casual user and more the industry professionals”. Well duh… it’s a pro phone. Hating for the sake of hating at this point.
@Stuntman707,"So the pros don’t really get a Hero feature this year. The ESR stand case is nice, the hinge has got a nice stiffness to it but the case doesn’t feel bulky. Protects the camera bump as well. Been using one on the iPhone 15 for a year."
@camoshooter3936,i am still wondering if i should buy 24 ultra or 16 pro max
@ROXAS1,Apple to making new Iphones is like EA to making new Madden Games..
@JJ2023.,"I&#39;m really disappointed that the base model still comes with a 60Hz screen in 2024—it&#39;s just not acceptable. I&#39;m also not a fan of the color options for the Pro models. For a device priced over $900, it&#39;s reasonable to expect a 120Hz display. Additionally, 8GB of RAM feels limiting, as it may shorten the device&#39;s lifespan, especially with more AI features being introduced, potentially forcing an upgrade within two years."
@Haahaa244,GUYS HELP HIM BEAT APPLE AGAIN!!
@vladandigirea1604,"Wer da price at ,it can have 69420 megapixels i dont care,i want to see DA PRICE!!"
@TheMikgus,"the only thing I looking forward with the new phone is iphone 15 lower price, and ai is 120% useless to me!"
@Ybry89,Such an apple thing to change the camera layout so you can have cool spatial videos on 3599 head set😂
@KinGaming401,We need Steve Jobs back. Ever since he died iPhone designs haven’t been the same. This line up is Mid. I’m more excited for the AirPods yet they still look the same too 😅
@rocus80m,My question is - how to use a case with this new button and all 4 microphones that comes with the new iPhone?
@UsmanAli-ve6tq,Can we deactivate camera control button? I don&#39;t think i will use. Apple has added extra button on iphone for no reason.
@milesparker6992,"Ah yes.. just the same fcking thing every year, but with a different camera module design. But people still eat it up like a homeless kid on a third world country who experienced Thanksgiving feast for the first time."
@mukharroy1775,"Mark my word, 1st major change will be iphone 20, its apple strategy. Every 10 years."
@nathanielmillington4950,Still rocking a 13PM without any reason at all to upgrade. All these features are just fluff to justify absurd spending. Safe your money for vacations and living life! 👍
@shuvankarroy7275,We should buy iPhone 13 instead of iPhone 16<br>Both are the same except processor 😊😊
@brolysujay,Apples talking apple sheep granted on whole new level. 😂
@Art_studio173,Why don&#39;t just add a finger print on the power button
@samnnamani,your iphone 15 unboxed just lost 50% of its value when you trade it in for the new iphone. This should be the reason why you either cut yourself out of this prison or stay in it and renew every 5 years
@rupertcornelius,what if you want to take pic/video &quot;upside down&quot; with the lens(s)/button on the bottom??? LAME DESIGN ...SJ would be pissed !

@shamimmustafa4649,"This is the first time since 2007 that I&#39;m NOT upgrading my 15 Pro Max!<br>Sad as it is, there is ABSOLUTELY no reason.<br>I was at least hoping for a 2TB version."
@KurzhaarBard,You should cover the new airpods. They have managed to sell having no voice cancellation as a feature. &quot;*Natural sound*&quot;

@deleted-something,At this point I think there’s only 6 people with the Apple Vision Pro 🤣
@ish_,"Would buy if I could pay to move my “camera control pressure sensitive actuator” to the bottom middle of my screen, make it circular, and add a fingerprint sensor to it."
@paganlord36,Honestly I think if people have older phones the 15pro/promax going on specials are going to be a better buy. The average consumer isn&#39;t going to use most of the &quot;innovations&quot;.  Maybe Apple will actually release a foldable by 2030.
@Castle02,Atleast provide a 90hz on the base variants. Was thinking of upgrading to the 16 but now I have to look for different options.
@user-kl9kg2uq9m,Definitely on apple salary.
@paulatreides7854,"Iphone 11 was the last breakthrough, after that every year is the same,12 same camera as 11 and worse battery. 13 little innovation ,little ram upgrade for base model. 14 same as 13 with similar cameras. 11 pro max is still competing imo,no reason to upgrade at all."
@PixelogistFacts,WHY ITS NOT FINGERPRINT SCANNER?
@filipthe2,Samsung has had an active button since way too long ago...
@NazimZaki,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=242"">4:02</a> it feels uncomfortable to use in portrait."
@kysim2rk,Guilliman using his logistical influence and prowess to force Apple into making his own colorway for iphones is crazy
@fireflamezdjflamez2966,if apple get boring one more time.
@keiyanna,every year adding another button 😅<br>apple in 2026 : &quot;were introducing the all new keypad buttons&quot;
@Elton-n8i,besides the iphone 16 the apple event sucked they didnt know what to do with the apple watch even if its the 10th anniverery and they just gave the airpods max new colors and usb c i think the regular 16 was the biggest thing. Also the 4th gen airpods was cool with noise cancelletion at that low of a price
@blazezw6156,u think the side slide button would work for tiktok? 🤔
@ferdinandkohler2575,buying an iphone nowadays is buying a hopeful promise. especially in germany. AI isnt even planned for germany. crazy…
@Michael-ct3hl,It&#39;s literally the same phone for 90% of ppl
@mathijs2682,is 256GB enough space if i want to buy the pro phone and use it for the next 4-5 years
@user-zh2gl6ko1q,Perpetual apple users are in a commercial commerce of abusive practices.... They get sold the same phone each time with the possibily of a bigger battery and as always a brand new feature android has had for 10 years.<br><br>Apple users you are what the end of civilisation looks like
@reyalPRON,"a 60hz screen in 2024 wont do.. even my budget ulefone armor has 120hz <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/8gF1Xp_zK8jk8gSDrI2wCw""></a><br><br>so its like all apple releases then? every second round has something &quot;new&quot; and this is just a facelift with extra bells and whistles. it used to be round, square, round, square :)"
@zwakeledube6807,"i noticed that most of your videos that cover the iphone are mostly soft. You  don&#39;t grill apple for the lack of improvements in their products and i think is because you have a liking for apple products. To summarise you know the iphone 16 is a money grab and yet you still justify it that,s just my opinion by the way"
@ScorpionNani,"I don&#39;t understand this trend to make the camera outlines so large compared to the camera. Is this to trick the users to think they have better cameras? Because that&#39;s what it feels like, that back camera is huge for basically nothing."
@mannydrives,"I want to plug in a KB&amp;M and connect to a screen to have full macOS. A real pocket computer I can take anywhere, wireless connect to peripherals and get things done."
@kxvxli,"Apple doesn&#39;t give people what the want though, they show  people what they want🥴💁🏿‍♂️"
@Bare_Essence,"Yeah. Now, can they just add an iOS option to disable the swipe left to start the camera on a lock screen? I&#39;m tired of opening the camera when I&#39;m swiping full left to clear a notification. They are just going to far, as you say, to differentiate a new OS or phone. You cannot just keep adding things without shutting off some partial overlapping things that only cause confusion or make user error easy/easier."
@dand2810,"after 3 years on Android, I can&#39;t see myself ever going back - it&#39;s like going back in time - old technology wrapped in an ugly package."
@nighttown24,Apple adding Google Ai smart replies and Android smart notification this year 😭
@fabianadavien,This is basically - iPhone 15 S. Or 15 SE.
@jordankeith9360,Wtf the same people phone from last year
@HarshPatel-u2i,Can you also make a video of the new AirPods and watch?
@kul795,Samsung taking notes
@AdamMckeithan,Here comes iPhone still has 60hz screen people. That’s not going matter to regular person (the people not watching this video).
@olegheifetz8947,"International users are not benefiting as much from the AI, because Samsung launched with 13 languages, and I think it stayed at that, iPhone launches monolingual and will add a few languages next year… don’t know how pixel goes about this."
@real.naveen,60 Hz screen in 2024 is biggest L move by Apple! !
@mueid7151,"The whole idea of apple from the start is telling people they are poor if they don&#39;t buy apple products. That&#39;s the reason they make so many sales around the world, because a lot of people buy iPhone as a symbol of wealth."
@hridoysharker1071,❤❤❤
@Jrg98987,Something feels familiar about this
@Jaeger-LeKilltre,one minute of silence for all Apple user that buy always the same phone from year to year
@YMB124,This video will definitely blow up🎉

All I can say is atleast they acted as a fingerprint sensor at the same time. Apple&#39;s introduction of the touch sensitive side button is very strange and probably will never be used"

@joalblo9581,I don&#39;t watch this channel normally because I do believe he has a bias towards Apple.... But I was curious about what he&#39;d say about such an underwhelming event. <br><br>What do you know? He actually called them out! <br><br>And 60hz in 2024... Really Apple? <br><br>My opinion... Apple&#39;s best products of 2024 from a value perspective considering features and cost... iPad Air 13 inch and iPhone 16 plus but that&#39;s only if your phone is 6 or 7 years old.

@zarirdaruwalla7187,I am really thinking as a lay man do we really need all these pro pro camera and AI features just for everyday use I mean.. can there not be better ways to upgrade the phone in terms of technology.. And yeah I feel that new button is an absolute waste you could rather have that in the action button which was already there

@grzib,Thermals ? I mean 15 Pro Max overheats really badly .
@_Meme_lord_1,To those saying the iPhone 16 is 60hz while android at £300 are 120hz. I can guarantee that the 16 is miles better than any £300 android. It’s built for battery life and for regular usages.

@user-iz4hd2qr4s,why do people still buy iPhones
@alishams4496,"hi, long time follower here, youve always said that you like features like these new camera features that give you more control and allow pros to take advantage of the pro tech used in the premium phones and had this argument against the iphone in favor of samsung and etc but now that iphone is adding &quot;pro&quot; features to the pro phones youre saying yeah nah i dont like this direction.<br>i personally as a power user very much want features in the cameras that give me more control and dont know why youre against it now"
@Ale-hc3uu,"I’m going to be completely honest: I love apple and the IOS system integration and everything,but seriously I have an iPhone 13 and I think that it’s not too different from an iPhone 16… It may not have the action button, the camera is different and all the tech stuff, but as a normal customer i think it’s basically the same product, and the only thing that change is the design and color."

@androidadvanced5068,"60 hz phone, end."
@Chaserbl,60hz in 2024 on phone that&#39;s 500eur and more
@Kwint.,My question is how will that camera button work if you have a phone case on it?
@TimpossibleOne,Apple kept regurgitating the same unwanted info over and over and so over info that would actually be useful
@WOTM8,Looks like it&#39;s another year for my 13 pro max..<br>they haven&#39;t managed to fix the bugs yet and now they&#39;re ready to introduce new bugs..? ehm! I mean features....?
@Tomino1302,"Guys I know we all think apple ran out of ideas because of 60hz on 2024!!!! But I think we all know deep down that apple does that so the Pro models have much more selling, they invest on pro models years now!"

@aearly841,"Surprised not many people have picked up on the fact that third party cases will have to have a cutout for the capture button, whilst the official Apple cases will not, because they will have some clever technology baked in. Smart move from Apple"
@wilsonzea5616,"I have to disagree with you when it comes to the button. I think it’s a great feature to have. It might not be useful for a lot of people, but it does not hurt to have."
@hendrasetiawan7220,wow the &#39;new camera layout&#39; is insane
@danudyaanc2724,What u expect from america company?
@vishaldobariya,Apple has really done a great innovation by keeping the iPhone 16 price lower than its predecessor. Other features are far from innovation. Warren buffet saw this coming and sold apple stocks at right time.
@aznin87,Iphone X: We tried to eliminate the button as many as possible by eliminating home button<br>Iphone 16: We added 2 buttons

@Minimaos1,I stoped copmaring the progress from the smartphones year by year to every 2 or 3 years. That&#39;s the only way you can get a relevant jump on your features
@sahilkamboj1372,It gotta be a case study to know how Apple gets away with this every year
@SpookyFairy,"next for iphone 17, physical keyboard, going full circle"
@Lcox654,"The problem with Apple Intelligence is that it doesn’t benefit the EU but the rest of the world, because of the regulations.

@Gkitchens1,"Ldont defend that camera button it’s what it is, stupid, tbh why already could have handled all this with software and already had a nice camera button in the Home Screen. It’s a gimmick just like the experimental stuff Samsung did forever. Not to say it’s useless, but it’s pointless."

@rudraaa445,"just need a new case and my iPhone 12 has a new name, iPhone 16 🤷🏻‍♂️✌️"
@xTunis1a,The same iphone as every year but a little bit more expensive
@derekth71,"I’m looking forward to trying out the camera button. I had a dual-stage shutter button on my Nokia phones years ago, and it’s pretty useful for picking a focal point and then reframing the shot so that focal point is off-centre, without needing to let go of the phone with one hand so you can prod a part of the screen to get that focus. A much easier way of working when the phone is held in your hands and not in some kind of mount."
@prosperplays8036,ULTRAMARINE??...FOR THE EMPEROR!!!!!
@alizaroe5426,I would prefer the new google pixels
@beasthunter4003,"Damn... the new iphone seems similar to the older model... couldn&#39;t have seen that coming, oh well, maybe next year then"
@duke973,60hz 😮😮 I really thought this year would be the year the regular version gets 120hz disappointed and not going to buy it like I was going to😢
@CuthbertS25,They couldnt part with the notch that they added a new button for it  to show on your camera app 😂 Innovation at its finest

@Seetheren,"I think the addition of the camera button might have pushed me out of the Apple ecosystem. If I am going to pay for an additional feature, I would rather pay for something like an s pen vs a new camera button."
@Laglessuser,&quot;Big moment to the 7 people that own the apple vision pro&quot;😂 bro had me
@auralplex,"It’s criminal that Siri has sucked for so long. An absolutely useless feature. Now they want to release a new version with AI. Guess what, Apple? I’m staying on my 13 pro, fk you for being so lazy."
@guitarboy0211,The fact that the 16/16 plus still have a 60hz display is a big deal breaker. £300 phones have 120hz screens OLED and they can&#39;t do 120hz on a phone that&#39;s more than 500? Nah they&#39;re just scamming at this point.
@slav_K0,Sony had that camera button in 2013.
@TimpossibleOne,I call the Action Button the Accident Button because every time I want to raise the volume I end up muting my ringer instead. It&#39;s too close to the volume buttons. That wasn&#39;t a problem with the physical switch because it was somewhat recessed but now this thing is in the way.

@codingCouncil,waiting patiently for MKBHD to be completely taken aback by how great this phone is :D
@lukefullerton509,Personally I wonder if the camera button is an attempt to try to get people not use a case. The more complex two stage press and trackpad-like swiping would not work with most cases.
@alexbooyse9053,I am finding it almost impossible to find a reason to care about this new iPhone.
@Minimaos1,That&#39;s exactly what people said when iPhone had the silince btn ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Technically  unecessary

@magnusjohansson7156,Im not supporting nor am i buying ai shit
@alvinperez3010,"i honestly don&#39;t get why you seem so disappointed.. you already know from the start that apple does only incremental updates... it&#39;s not like apple is holding you at gunpoint and forcing you to buy their new products... if you don&#39;t want to buy the new products, then don&#39;t... apple releases new products because that is their business... they&#39;re in the business to earn money and they probably will because of the AI stuff... they cannot be changing their phones looks every year... that era of different looks in mobile phones  was done eons ago... now is the era of gradual  updates.. if the people are not satisfied with their new products, then let them know by not buying them... that&#39;s the only way they&#39;ll change their business model... otherwise they will continue because at the end of the day, people will still buy their stuff regardless of what other people feel..."

@deuter458624,I’m still a huge fan of the diagonal camera design of the 13-14 iPhone models it’s unique and not boring. Designwise.
@13YearOldTalksAboutTech,I just found a phone that costs $110 brand new and has 120hz. Apple is so innovative that they kept the 60hz to be unique! Great! (Phone name is Redmi C63 5g)
@trivet1970,if i was not already on the auto upgrade program this is the first year i would just keep my 15 pro max.
@JoaoSampaio-ts2eg,Me and my brother were watching the event and when they said”big boost” he started screaming to the screen
@KGi4,"Maybe iphone should work on better grip materials so people won&#39;t use cases for their phones cuz now they highlights their unique color choices but people still use case, so what&#39;s the poin if customer never get to show but hide it instead 😁😁😁"
@emmontelyzardiezmo2101,That&#39;s SUCKS it&#39;s almost like iphone 12 whaha😂😂
@highlightshadow,Apple still uses the storage capacity as the sneak &quot;from £xxx&quot; tagline. Given they start at 128 and still include 256. It&#39;s £300 to get the 512GB uplift. Makes it a lot less competitive
@EGamer05,Seriously though when apple is going make phone like a fold or flip or something better than that. Never??

@rachegreenrg,Junk.
@kurdkurdo989,Does it really woth to buy tho?
@kraken598,You want to enjoy you new iphone? change it every 3 or 4 years!!! I have a 13 pro max and for me i think will be a good upgrade 😊
@LordOfJazz,Might just be the iPhone with the smallest &quot;upgrades&quot;. Absolutely zero reason to buy. If I was needing a new phone I&#39;d just get the 15 for cheaper.
@avxlooo,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=91"">1:31</a> 💀"
@kratosnoone,Apple will indirectly get the money from lot of broken screens. This camera button placement is to make sure people slip or drop the phone so often to make them visit to apple store again
@RealHouseMouse2,"I can’t wait for the 16 pro max to be released, so that I can buy a 15 pro max for cheap"
@BlackMercy-it1jp,I&#39;ve seen $150 chinese phones with 120hz OLED screens meanwhile Apple sells a $900 phone with a 60hz screen
@dad_jokes_4ever226,Meh ...🥱
@framethesummit,Just buy a Samsung 😁
@NotOpusYT,"I feel like personally the manual shutter is useful for smaller objects, an example, I can’t film spiders or small insects well on the 15 pro because of auto focus, but with a manual I could get it right since the phone apparently don’t know what I’m trynna focus on 😅❤"
@MarluxiaXia,"Ok, I’ll skip the 16pro, i’ll try the Google Pixel 9 pro 🫡"

@kpshahul,"What ever the Apple Inc does... I mean any kind of BS.. they make Billions out of their iphones... It just goes on to show how much dumb people are to shell so much money for a smartphone.<br> And other major thing is, since iPhone 16 design has remained almost same as older version, none other phones will have new designs. All other brands too lack innovation."
@ISHRAIHAN.,60hrz in 2024 should be banned
@Zantesuken,I feel they only &quot;jumped forward&quot; from A16 to A18 was to make it sound more impressive

@kill3rbyysight,worst colour scheme ever Iphone 16
@nicksmith8141,Apple Intelligence offers a bunch of novelty features that you will probably rarely use or try once. It&#39;s a buzzword they are adding to everything while keeping the phone relatively unchanged.
@ckraiygel,When will you be covering the nothing phone 2a plus
@HEISENBERGonMETH,nah but 60hz is base variant is nuts
@bbyboy2538,blah blah blah. all i heard was apple copied everything from android. they must be running out of ideas

@bufoot,I&#39;m annoyed by this AI nonsence. Every company is selling Software as Artificial Intelligence. Years ago those Software features were just apps.
@wensiangfong,I think apple is a bloated company now. Full of useless high paid people. Just like the previous twitter. <br>I m surprised that they cant even get their so call apple Ai ready before selling the product. <br>Is this how apple wanna follow garbage gaming industry? Selling game which is not ready?
@Peizxcv,Apple always film their promo videos in Detroit and Bronx; you rarely see other type of American in their videos
@psibug565,TBH these iPhones look good apart from the down grade of the mute switch which is the one button that I don’t want to be hunting for on a touch screen or have to check in said screen. Camera Button is an actually useful thing. I would note that the hearing heath feature on the iPods Pro are much more meaning full then anything happening on a phone.

@aaronharris2684,Siri has been the weakest pillar of IOS for some time - HAHHAAHAH so funny yet so true.    I personally wish they deleted SIRI and just admitted they have CHATGPT doing all the AI work. That would&#39;ve been the honest comment from Apple

@Sharvil_Saraiya,Instead of adding these many features they should work on resolving the existing bugs

@psazim31,For someone who uses their iPhone with their left hand. I’m worried I might just keep clicking the camera button
@muhammadsaaddastgeer,Every apple user is only a victim of complexity. The iPhone is the biggest piece of shit on which you can waste your money on smart and intelligent people who don&#39;t buy iphone because they know its a waste of money and doesn&#39;t have that many features samsung is providing alot better features and settings
@AgastyaSingh,60hz on the normal iphone is criminal. They should be publicly flogged.
@bubeleretshe2251,The 7 people that own Apple Vision Pro are catching strays 😭😭
@stijnVDA1994,"Honestly the fact apple makes these wierd choices makes it feel like apple is in panic mode wich started when they lost on the camera front, then came the(kinda) smart ai on android made their panic mode even worse and so rushed the 16 aswel as the latest ipad just before... and then the fact they shot off the 16 early without the software and basic what there is is a more exspensive 15...<br>I think samsung won&#39;t have thát much of ahard time with the s25 series even if the ultra&#39;s screen isn&#39;t as big as the biggest iphone 16..."

@hamzapetridis206,"I was gonna buy it to upgrade from my 11 this year. Then I heard the battery which is the most important thing for me had a “very big boost” without being quantified as they do for everything, so I’ll wait a year to see if they announce something good for the 17."
@RJpkc-s2d,"its sad to see how far apple has fallen in innovation, and they will get away with it each time because their cult eats it up"
@RhazCastillon,"The fall of apple. I have not switched from my iphone 12 promax until this day. I cannot feel excitement anymore, nothing really new features just new marketing strategy that does not appeal anymore. I would like to get the samsung flip6 ❤❤❤❤"

@Traeknald,"the camera control button has the MASSIVE benefit of finally allowing mobile games to use two &quot;triggers&quot;, the volume/action button for the left trigger, and the camera control button for the right trigger"
@steve9584,"What does it actually mean to be “jumping two generations ahead on the chipset”? It’s all arbitrarily named by Apple, so this set could have easily been the A17, no? It’s like saying they jumped two generations when they released the 8 and 10 at the same time. <br><br>I’m not an apple hater, just wondering why some of this stuff is said the way it is, as if we stole next year’s tech or something."
@romanosparris1021,i think more impressive that the iphone 16 is that i watched this video exactly at 1.000.000 views and when ended the views count was 1.104.000
@zaxlee01,Still no fast charging? Such a shame man.
@cro996,Why are you showing 16 Pro as pink colored don&#39;t get it?
@Ic3h0t,My iPhone 11 still works as a charm. Definitely not upgrading this year either. Every year is the best iPhone ever but what they offer is too little to deserve the very high prices.
@user-qu5gs8ly5i,I like going to phone review comments to see all the banter that happens here
@BattleRapMultiverse,Apple just took a lot of Google features and applefied them. The audio one is already available on Pixels. Everything you said is already on the pixels 9XL except 4k 120fps.

When we go to a Google Pixel video, we don&#39;t hear the same negative demeanor: &quot;Well, it&#39;s nothing Samsung haven&#39;t put out already&quot; People are so damn blind, the actual hate on Apple is ridiculous and it&#39;s absolutely fueled by YouTubers. If Apple puts out something in September, which Samsung released in January, then of course Samsung is first. We know Apple will release in September and we know Samsung will release in January, we&#39;re not fooling anyone here. I think the videos are getting sloppy and even more biased than they used to be."
@isahsteve-rh4gc,The gimmick on top of this new iPhone is massive
@NomadOutdoorAdventures,I totally agree. That camera button looks awesome on paper but look at how many people put third-party iPhone cases on their phone that will probably not properly work with that button. It will probably end up never using it. That’s how I feel about it that I’ll probably end up putting some third-party phone case on it yet. I do a lot of videoing and will probably never use that button.
@theoparry5283,apple has more subscribers again… looks like you’ll need to start making another massive iphone for when you surpass them again
@elynnyan6450,"I own the 15 pro max, so not sure if it would be worth an upgrade for me."

@pensforgts,"As far as I can understand, apple will scrap all the other buttons and assign this one a.i button to do all functions we may need. Just special gesture and you can turn volume up and down etc. We will probably ser this on iPhone 18"
@alexmiladinov4485,60 hz again is craaaaaaaaaazy
@Hartbreak1,I wonder why every year tech reviewers put a surprised Pikachu face and act disappointed wondering why every “new feature” on a new iPhone has been done before in another phone. Tech reviewers I hate to break it to you but that Apple that brought cutting edge features hasn’t existed for a very looooong time now. Acting disappointed every year is no longer novel. It’s time to accept reality.
@HCPchannel.,"Part of the first to comment under 5 hours, please can I have  one am in Nigeria"

@KICK839,60hz
@Expanded_Hyrule,I feel like we&#39;ve already reached the top of what iphones are capable of. Nothing ground-breaking or even &quot;new&quot; is coming out from pretty much all phone company&#39;s this year. The hardware of Phones are already as good as they can possibly be. Now its just a case of making a slightly different phone every year to make some money and keep the company afloat.
@TazBo-wd2ig,sticking with my iPhone 14 Pro. Apple are being super lazy
@prajwalmali,Apple as always is going more 🏳️‍🌈 while Samsung as always is going more 🗿

@Cas_anova,"Wait, Beyonce is 43??"
@frankbacon1002,"Honestly the stock tumble they saw after this event is totally deserved. One of the most boring and un-innovative tech events I&#39;ve ever witnessed live. So incredibly boring. They could&#39;ve returned the Mini model which honestly may have made this event worthwhile and fun. <br><br>I truly do hope they have something big planned for the next generation bc at this rate, Apple is experiencing a slow death. Their competitors caught up. The Apple brand is becoming cheaper with time since it seems like everyone has an iPhone, therefore it&#39;s brand power is weaker than before, yet they refuse to make a midrange or entry level device that could help adoption massively. They can&#39;t invent new categories of tech since there are no possible new things they can come up with unfortunately. Apple Vision won&#39;t save them either, since it&#39;s been thoroughly demonstrated that AR is a gimmick and more of a burden to users than a convenience."
@Darsh__2012,6.9&quot; less ggoooo
@Eric-jo8uh,Nothing new…except a new price. Will wait for Tesla’s new phone.
@BojanBojovic,"I love Apple products, but paradoxically in the same time find them made for stupid people. Very confusing company, good products overall, but idiotic in so many ways. I believe the iPhone is the biggest problem here, also the biggest success. Although being successful with TikTok generation is not something to be proud of."
@naryanr,The only reason they&#39;re pushing 4K 120fps now<br>is to basically force you to get the 256 GB model<br>which is probably like $300 more.<br>That&#39;s where the real money comes from.<br>It&#39;s the smartphone equivalent of what&#39;s essentially Sony&#39;s PS5 DualSense subscription service.
@1tan_freed0m,"Feels like Apple has run out of ideas, They perfect stuff before releasing it, unlike Android phones. But Android phones are not afraid to do experiments and they have passed Apple as I feel. I&#39;ll probably move to a simple Android phone like Nothing or Pixel or maybe an iPhone next. Since I need some basic devices to do basic stuff. In my mind as a user of both but, more Android, Apple should be basic and simple without many features or anything. That was the original flavor.😅"

@thinkergesh,"As a loyal iPhone user for 12 years, I&#39;m disappointed to say that the iPhone 16 launch offered no significant upgrades. I&#39;m convinced that the Samsung S25 Ultra will outperform the iPhone and bridge the gap once and for all. Several friends have already made the switch from iPhone to the S24 Ultra and are thrilled. Apple is now playing catch-up to stay relevant. Fellow Apple enthusiasts will understand my sentiments.😢"

When they will release a  n iphone 18 Premium instead of pro, it will be acceptable to be just a regular phone with 1 atom deep gold coating. As long as the auto camera is excellent, I have no issues with pro mode."
@IAmSuperFoX96,Apple is just making a fool of us now<br>Nothing new same features same design and features which have been in other phones from years are being introduced now<br>Boring not worth the upgrade

@gohkairen2980,they mentioned apple intelligence so many times throughout the event to the point that i have to stop watching
@abouteverything2115,There is a very good reason for new buttons: so that you have to get rid of your perfectly functioning iPhone 12 to 15 and buy 16 because your old phone is now considered physically OS-crippled.
@tenorenstrom,How is Apple intelligence in other languages? And is it even coming to EU?

@sivasanthoshr.m2222,They just make sure their camera bump is different in each model so they have to buy a new case for each one

They are groundbreaking in the world of Iphone and 99% iphone users don&#39;t even consider any other companies phones as an option or care about their existence. The fact that they are coming to Iphone now means that these features came to existence and that is groundbreaking

@anthonysimpson6738,"Boring…. as a iPhone 13 mini owner I am more interested in the Motorola flip razer than a new iPhone. I can’t see how Apple A.I is even helpful, who owns an Apple vision, no one. The Pro’s colours are way boring, the Pro phone should allow customers to choose custom phone colours. I then looked at the Series ten AppleWatch I own a series six. There is absolutely nothing to upgrade too and actually I want a smaller watch they keep making it bigger. They should release a kids watch. The AppleWatch can’t be paired with your car audio, you have to take you’re phone. I like the Android flip phones small but big screen. I think Apple are going to be disappointed. The fact Apple aren’t popular in China says they not innovative. I also dislike the two tier level with their phones it is elitism that Pro phones get more. They need another Steve Jobs, it like they run out of steam."
@ikon9046,Apple never fails to disappoint
@ragnarsahranavard8866,Have i upgrade to 16 pro max from 15 pro max???
@BoccaccioAC,"The camera button appears to be very flimsy and complciated to maneuver. Unusable in protrait mode which is defacto standard nowadays. As you said, its maybe for 2% out there. <br>I wonder how many will touch it unintentionally?! <br>In the end like the action button and dynamic island: theoretically a nice feature button not a game change in interaction and usability."
@xBinyWolf,So this year we have: iphone 12 ssss as base iphone 16 BUT NOW 1 MORE BUTTON. And we have 12 pro SSSS BUT NOW WITH A FEATURE YOU HAVE TO BUY THE MOST EXPENSIVE MODEL TO USE AND 1 MORE BUTTON! Thank you apple for not abusing your status

@SpirituelleSicht,"Garbage Phone overall, overrated company"
@aadstagram,"I think you may have missed a use case for the dedicated camera button. My partner has tiny hands and she struggles taking a group selfie one-handed. Also, I personally want to use the action button for something else so having a dedicated camera button is great. Can&#39;t wait to get mine. Been on the 12 pro max for way too long."
@gwin8463,iPhone &quot;no upgrade &quot;😂😂😂
@softbreeze941,I don&#39;t live my life in some instagram or twitter etc. The camera button is the most exciting thing as 99% photos are landscape anyway and opening the camera from a pocket always ready to shoot is amazing!
@johnmatrix-qf4jd,Still can’t believe they have that stupid island cutout. Terrible fad that died out ten years ago in android.  Sticking with my 13 pm for another year at least.

@JoeZn-vz3dg,They are really out of ideas 😂 samsung is crushing them reallyy hard ..so sad for the iphone 16 😂 who&#39;s stupid enough to buy one still the same phone 😂😂😂
@PocketUau,"The only new thing is that they added redundant camera controls 3cm away from where they already were on screen, making it easier to drop your phone, and the new controls nearly unusable with a case.<br><br>That&#39;s it, that&#39;s all worthy of note. This deserved to be called 15s at most, not 16"
@spadigy3371,"Guys stop hating on apple for apparently not innovating, the mobile phone industry across all companies is stuck. There are no longer any new “revolutionary features” in every phone designing company such as Samsung and Xiaomi too"

@genbhu2697,Odd number iphones&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;even number iphones
@VRctrl,"Its pretty clear that A.I is the way forward for inovation in phones and its seems Apple&#39;s camera slider button is trying to compensate for their lack of A.I features, that we see its competitors doing such as Googles Gemini and Samsungs Galaxy A.I which are so well intergrated into Google&#39;s Pixel and Samsung&#39;s Galaxy phones."

@RAFLarchitects,"not buying until i got to know the actual battery capacity. the specs for the 16 pro just say 27hrs video playback for example. but as for the 15 pro max, it only gets a full day of usage. like 8-9 hours max under normal usage."

@justamanofculture12,"My Samsung Galaxy S10+, 1TB/12GB, is better than this Pathetic Iphone 16 😂............"

Google is even worse, software software software, people dont give a shit.<br><br>Hey Apple, there is something called touchID on new Macbooks and old iPhones, you could implement it under the display on new iPhones.<br>And also, when you slim down the bezzels, the HUGE (!) camera cutout becomes even more obstructive. <br><br>Same Design for so many years now AND BECAUSE THEY KNOW they dont have that many differences, especially hardware differences between the non pro and pro models, they put a 60Hz display onto the non pro devices to segment the product portfolio. 2024, almost 2025 and these expensive phones havent got a 120hz display.<br><br>Mindblowing tbh.<br><br>While apple didnt really convince me with their new products, i have to say for the first time ever (!) I actually like the non pro Models much more. Especially the colours are super nice. Well done apple, it took you guys 20 years to find actual COLOURS… but yeah, you failed with the pro model colours anyways so thats a draw i guess😁"

@MVIVN,"I&#39;m one of the people you mentioned at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=405"">6:45</a> who have just been waiting for what feels like a true game-changer upgrade, and so far I haven&#39;t seen anything that compels me to ditch my regular iPhone 13, which still does everything I need it to do well enough. I don&#39;t do any gaming on my phone and just take basic photos of friends/family, so even though they market all these cool new camera things and claim 50% graphics performance improvement year-over-year, it&#39;s still not a good enough reason (for me) to buy a new phone. I&#39;m not even sold on Apple Intelligence because I have a ChatGPT subscription like a lot of other people do, and if I really need to do general AI tasks like sprucing up an important email or whatever I just use ChatGPT, and even then I very, very rarely ever do stuff like that anyway. I&#39;ll wait and see a full review and if I find myself thinking, woah, Apple Intelligence could really genuinely improve my day-to-day life in some way, then I might change my mind and buy a new iPhone, but I&#39;m not there yet after watching the keynote. In any case, when my iPhone 13 starts to feel slow and frustrating to use (which will inevitably happen anyway because that&#39;s just how it goes with tech) then I&#39;ll buy a new iPhone out of necessity eventually. Will that be iPhone 16? Probably not. I am perfectly happy waiting for iPhone 18, or 19 even!"

@pitchan3786,"Wait, I thought Apple would be &#39;button-less&#39; on iPhone 16 models. Huh, seeing more buttons added makes it less innovative and actually downgrade from 15s. So are they going to finally add FM Radio app and put back the headphone jack on iPhone 17s? If so, I can finally switch to iOS!"

@chriswest2290,I run both iPhone and Samsung.  Regardless of the hardware.  iOS is so efficient. It’s just one layer.  As opposed to android with a retro layer of Google and sometimes Facebook ontop. <br>iOS runs very close to the hardware. Close to metal.  <br>Android featuring Google always just feels a bit janky. <br>But I love both my 13 mini and Samsung s23.
@zabak759,Even iPhone 8 has 4 microphones. Just nobody talks about it that they have it on all iPhones for years😅 the only difference is that they’ll be a bit better I guess
@JustIen-0,The features and design of iphone 16 doesn&#39;t impressed me.........
@glyngreen538,I still take 90% of my photos as landscape and very rarely bother posting photos on social media these days anyway (maybe a few times a year or so) so I welcome the new camera button placement. It seems like a good call for the more into photography people.

@imluctor5997,Good phone but I think its going to drop in sales purely because the base model doesn’t have 120hz refresh rate. Its the only thing they should have done to make it perfect. Ofc the baseline is never perfect. They always tryna make you upgrade to the pro in some way. Unfortunately I might move to samsung flagship next year if 17 baseline doesnt have 120hz.

@18632,Honestly not fussed about another button. What they should have done is also add double tap to the action button. What I find really really interesting is that up to 250 cycles of charge on my iPhone 15 pro I was on 100% battery. Now I am at 339 cycles and my battery has dropped to 92%. People may say that is normal but my girlfriend is at exactly 92% with 304 cycles also but she got her phone a month after me. Battery use to last all day. Now I’m charging twice a day. Funny how this happens so close to new phones coming out 😡 Apple has forced me to leave and go to Pixel 9 Pro
@1snico1,My god apple is boring these days..

@nazim4486,60hz screen in 2024 is crazy stupid
@LiamSteenbergen,finaly SOMEthing changed
@pantr565,"Okay, let&#39;s talk about the cameras:<br><br>4K 120fps is a nice feature, but I have to agree with you that 128GB aren&#39;t enough to &quot;carry&quot; the storage needs of such features.<br><br>As a both iPhone and Android user, I have to say that iPhone&#39;s camera system has always been more focused on the casual &quot;Auto Mode&quot; user (just remember that in the stock camera app there isn&#39;t a pro mode with full manual settings), providing a solid experience that even many of the &quot;professionals&quot; prefer. So, this change of the focus to the &quot;professional features&quot; is a bit weird move for Apple, but as long as the casual user continues on getting a solid experience, it will be fine for everyone.<br><br>As for the 5x telephoto on the iPhone 16 Pro, I have to say that I can appreciate a periscope lens only as a 4th lens, just like Samsung has done with s24 ultra. In practice, I use way more often my 3x lens (of my iPhone 14 Pro) than my 5x lens (of my older but still powerful Huawei P30 Pro), because this is a way more useful focal length for both portraits and landscape photography. I like the ability to zoom but I&#39;m not willing to sacrifice the quality between 2,1x and 4,9x, which is a big &quot;focal length hole&quot;. So, I hate this trend of replacing the normal telephoto lenses with periscope ones just to impress. Am I the only one? 😅"

@ErnPrivado,iphone 16 feels like the right upgrade without going pro. the pro has too much feature that normal people will not really use. unlike when15 and 15 pro was release it was never a good decision to get the 15
@user-fv1el5bw5v,i dont like this one. it litarally looks the same as the iphone x. APPLE just why ?
@Jones117,128gb I’m 2024 💀
@Quincyvhs,"Can we talk about how at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=265"">4:25</a> you mentioned that they’re showing off controlling “focus” and that thats a useless feature. But in reality the “F2.8” is actually for aperture.. “F” as in “F-stop”. It’s basically for the emulated depth of field. You can use it to control the background blur. Which is great for photographers and cinematographers!! Not a useless feature at all!"

@vecsy90,"First I was shocked how expensive these phones are in Europe (16 - €959; 16Pro - €1,219), but then I&#39;ve realised the new Pixel 9 lineup is priced very closely to that (€899; €1,099) 🤷‍♂️<br>I&#39;ll stick to changing phones every 4 years. My first car 12 years ago was €400 😅"
@TheHuski,"I have a iPhone 13 and seriously not really impressed by the 16.   Pretty much looks the same as older iPhones.   Most of the upgrades is Software based and very little Hardware.   For the most users we don;t need a Super computer chip to run Messenger, Safari, Email and make and receive calls.   Doubt I will upgrade yet."
@liam_carolus,"Missed opportunity, integrating a finger print sensor into the camera button."

@chrisdnz7,"Apple really need to move to a longer phone hardware release cycle now. Most improvements we all want is coming from software. I still use a 13 mini, and still see no reason to upgrade it and im someone that prior to that phone upgraded every 1 or 2 years. I dont see anything new in this phone thats not just a gimmic that will draw some people in and theyl stop using it not long after. <br><br>How many people actually point the camera at things to learn more about them? i dont know anyone who wouldnt just type in to google search because they forget they could even do it with the camera mainly due to the need to use that is probably once or twice a year"
@BishalKhan01,"I honestly think that if you had an older iPhone, like the 12 or older, this would be a great time to make the upgrade. Good luck Arun with the battery tests, hopefully you&#39;ll be able to sleep a bit."
@Zomboy4313,"Overall a pretty ok improvement, but I’ll keep my 15 Pro until it either breaks or runs out of software support"
@TheMusikalChef,Android users watching from the corner and feeling so satisfied that we are way ahead of iphone 😎
@abetheophilus547,"I didn’t think you’d ever complain about too much features on an iPhone. In my personal opinion I believe it was the best decision to give professional advance features to the pro iPhones. So if you’re a pro you know what to get, and if not you also know what not to. Simple"
@zeidra21flips74,My Mi 11 got updated to Hyper os and it ruined the entire phone slow to turn on and extreme lag. Now i have a iPhone 12 PRO Max and its super good. And we still have Pepole complaining about the latest Model i could have had a 14 plus and i would have Been Happy.

@Peizxcv,"I took 20000 photos within the last 12 months on my iPhone 14 / 15 Pro Max most using the action button to start the camera app. But I know I am not going to use the new “camera” button to take photo because it’s gonna induce vibration and if I am going to stand there and slowly adjust all the parameters, there are better “pro” apps for that"

The 16 have way more vibrant colors, for good and bad. <br>And while the Iphone are a better phone and camera overall, I really miss the camera functions from the Xperia, and the excellent focusing.

@summayalhassan592,We need a comparison between IP 16 pro and S24U in every aspect 🎉
@RichCow-xe1bz,The reason apple makes subtle difference with the iPhones appearance is literally so people can tell you are sporting an older one or the new one. Some people feel like they have to always have the newest models. If they kept them exactly the same lots of people wouldn&#39;t feel the need to upgrade
@VanOuzala,These are remarks from someone who is not a photographer 😅

@jacksmith-ht3jo,This genuinely doesn&#39;t even feel like an &#39;s&#39; upgrade I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s more of an upgrade between the 6 and the 6s
@MorgFlame,I always wondered if apple will switch to anew camera layout one day. I mean sure the features are cool but what situation do you need to be in to get those shots 😂
@snotjeinjenekkie,Does anyone know if the iPhone 15 also does have the “clean up” function or the interruption mode? Or does only the new iPhone 16 have them?
@ItsCrawdaddy,"How is this camera button going to be effected if i (like most people, i assume) throw a case on the phone immediately? That&#39;s my main concern. I can live with everything else. But if it fucks with case ability/protection, I&#39;ll just get a 15 plus."

@geordiebakker6391,What im most curious about is the battery on the 16pro cause my 15pro is really bad i need to charge it as soon as i come home from work Which is really annoying if i have to work longer / have erens to run and pray that my phone survives.<br>it has 97% battery capacity left after 262 charging cycles. <br>i do limit the charging to 80% because it doesnt make a lot of diffenence even if i would charge it too 100% (i have tested this for a period)<br>Its just more harmfull for my battery
@ThriftyCat,iPhone just kinda waits til someone else does something then they dive on it
@lazyJ-k2,Iphone 16 will be a flop...
@CaptainKirk7,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=269"">4:29</a> when he talks about focus it’s actually about the aperture f. Those are not the same and it makes sense to control that in such a situation."
@AbhishekSingh-hy7hb,"I&#39;ve been waiting to buy an iPhone since the iPhone 15 Pro Max was launched. I told myself I would only buy an iPhone when they changed the design, like introducing a flip model or some other significant change. Every year, I&#39;ve been disappointed because there hasn&#39;t been any major design shift. I don&#39;t plan to buy the iPhone 16 now, as it looks the same as previous models. It looks like I&#39;ll need to wait another year and see what the iPhone 17 offers; hopefully, there will be a new design."

@milinddixit6583,The nearly bezeless front looks really good. That alone seems a good upgrade if you&#39;re considering getting a 15 Pro or 16 Pro.<br><br>But personally I think they should&#39;ve saved that for next year and called this a 15 Pro S or 15 S since that&#39;s what it is.
@SMelk01,Past Technology with Marketing of Present and Pricing of Future.

@darrenvinculado4293,"I currently have the Iphone 11 and tbh it&#39;s still a good phone and upgrading to the latest model isn&#39;t really worth it if they add few things every model, maybe if they add something original and unique that other phones don&#39;t have. And if they managed to make the camera lens actually zoom and not an artificial zoom thing they do, so you actually get the full quality instead of the bad looking photos and videos you get. If they do those things I will definitely upgrade to the latest iPhone Model"

@htw007,"Major smartphone companies are eagerly showcasing the latest AI technology, but just how &quot;smart&quot; is this AI really? Let me explain it better: most AI features require an internet connection, meaning they are linked to a remote (super)computer that performs the &quot;magic&quot; and sends the result back to your phone screen. The real question is, can all these AI services they advertise operate purely based on the phone&#39;s software and hardware, without an internet connection?<br><br>Many electronic devices are being marketed as &quot;AI-ready,&quot; but in reality, the hardware they use isn’t equipped to handle AI on its own. They rely heavily on the internet to work their so-called magic, which can feel misleading. This is where we can truly gauge whether the new processors or motherboards can manage AI functions independently. Everything else is just a way to impress the public."

This reminded me of nexus 7 tab we had around 2012-13 (memories 🥹)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     (If this continues iPhone are more likely to replace iPad before, iPad replaces Macbook :D)"
@DrMintyy,"The sad thing is, everyone complains about how very little Apple seem to do between iPhone models, but they still buy, every year, without fail.<br>Why?<br>I&#39;m still on the iPhone 13 pro max, because i just don&#39;t see what else is beneficial between this new iPhone 16 pro max, and mine, 3 to 4 years down the line. Plus, i don&#39;t want any AI crap on my phone. No thanks. Stop being so damn lazy people."
@arcx7880,Bold of them to rename AI to Apple Intelligence
@user-eh3bh8ft4q,My android phone already has an action button  😂
@Hejdhehehuejeu,Upgrading only when iphones will have punch hole cameras. 😂
@coryholding232,"Gonna see how this phone stands up to the google pixel 9 line, I bet you’ll do a video comparing the two I’d love to see that!!"
@jamaar_gobaat,"How that Marques has left, you’re really the boss."
@subhansheikh2282,"the camera comparison between pixel 9 pro xl , galaxy s24 ultra and the 16 pro max is gonna be insane"
@Toxic_Waste92,"I’d argue that the Spatial Video isn’t really just an “Apple Vision Pro” feature. Since Spatial Video was added it’s become viewable on some versions of the Quest VR headsets. Likely this will expand to more headsets and bring the 3D feeling video into the hands of many more people. This is actually a good move by Apple who would have normally locked that to Apple devices only… this could bring Spatial Video into the mainstream and make it a much more utilized feature.<br><br>For me, I have 2 issues with the device. The first being that camera button… I don’t see myself using that to flip between modes on my camera. But the sensor is a forced cut out on cases for the device. I wish I could just turn the button off and have a full protective case without the button exposed as if it wasn’t even there. I work in road construction painting lines on the road. I am often around different pavement marking materials, the glass beads used to make lines reflective and when we fabricate things we are often surrounded by metal dust. I’d prefer to not have this button cut out of the case and be a prime point for dust, dirt, paint and glass bead to make it inside my case/phone.<br><br>Next is MagSafe. I find it pointless as wireless charging has never really been something I use for my phone and the magnets do nothing for me but attract metal dust. Previously I’ve been able to get an Otterbox Defender Series case without MagSafe, which made it so no metal dust got into my device. But with the new cases having a notch in the side and no versions without MagSafe… I’m just frustrated.<br><br>I know I’d fall into the minority of users. People like MagSafe and like buttons with functionality that makes device usage easier… but it isn’t worth the drawbacks for me. I have an iPhone 12 Pro and wanted to upgrade. I was torn between the 15 Pro Max or the 16 Pro Max. I decided to just go for the better device but I just wish I could opt out of the button and MagSafe within the software and with third party cases"
@Robman92,Worth upgrading from iphone 13 pro max?
@yamahaevo,This channel became boring.
@delbroox,Why Apple does not upgrade THE KEYBOARD instead of all the other pointless niche features???! It is the one thing everyone has to interact with consistently all the time on a phone and it is the one thing that is consistently horrible and much worse than the competition...
@phenomheights,You know your stuff man. Thank you for a detail review just few hours after the launch
@HiddenWen,Apple is just phoning it in with their products.
@ToiletTimeMeMes,They should enable both extra buttons for gaming !!!
@caeptnmorgan,Apple has to be joking. This is so 🤡<br>Glad im switched to Samsung last week
@michalrv3066,I like the new camera button but real shutter button on Xperia looks much better than whatever touch crap apple did.
@scottaltham6189,"The question for me is, are these new features making any real difference in day to day phone use. I feel like we&#39;re well past what any normal user needs with features that justify a new price, but don&#39;t really change how people use their phones. If we did an experiment and we all had to use the iPhone X for a year, we&#39;d be absolutely fine. AI aside, as that&#39;s more likely to change peoples usage behaviour. I just don&#39;t think we need annual phone upgrades anymore."
@livestreamcommenter8307,All that bull shit and no side finger print sensor
@REDPANDA4LINUX,Idea: take the action button. put it away. replace it with the shutterbutton. Boom you have an better action button. Webe scrolling with tiktok on this one🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥

@wavesnowaves,Let&#39;s just accept that having a yearly release cadence is pointless.
@diooverheavenrequim,depressing
@heybigbender,"lol, I remember buying a Huawei P8 Max back in like 2015/16 and the 6.8 inch screen was comically large. Granted the body made it much bigger, but its wild to see the iphone hitting those numbers. We&#39;re a long way away from &#39;Apple would never release a phablet&#39; haha."

@jakatubhai,apple has just copied samsung&#39;s design language...i don&#39;t know why people are comparing it to the iphone x
@K_Isla,Adding more buttons is adding more repair hardware.

@lekidusyared6072,S25 is coming 😘
@sabbirpriyo6222,So basically they did nothing.
@giuseppekakra2381,I think this year is just a transition year for apple…they normally do this before then a year later changing the whole design…about the AI staff I mean you can’t really complain that’s the standard for every phone now
@liammistry37,"feels like they kneecapped the batter performance of the 16 plus so the pro plus has a selling point, I know many who bought the regular plus just for the battery life."

@qbanz00,So it’s basically an iPhone 11 with a few tweaks 😂
@sarvech76,I really appreciate the skeptical look at the new phones this year. Sure feels a bit cynical at times but frankly I am tired of the &quot;ALL HAIL APPLE&#39;s MAGIC&quot; vibes I am getting from other reviewers.

@MoonKeyDLaughy,Ok am keeping my IPhone 14 Pro Max another year 😂
@Amin_2k,Does anyone actually game on their phone?
@memoktc,I feel the most wasted button is that camera button because they could have used that space for touchID which can double as a Ai button.why not give us dual authentication on the iPhone with that space instead of just zooming or changing exposure which we already can do.
@ankithg2297,dont care samsung better ...........no hate to arun
@royjohnson1524,iPhone 19 will probs look the same lol
@ESKATEUK,How will that new touch sensitive button work with a case?
@dohuuhailong8352,tldr: just use android
@ihsan_ali16,I like how Apple discreetly talks about IPhone 16 Pro titanium material grade 5 “Stronger and more scratch resistant than any other phone.”<br><br>Classic Apple won’t admit how bad IPhone 15 Pro titanium was very weak.
@kgamer69,"Apple is actually out of ideas now, it&#39;s actually good for them (proves that they have reached the pinnacle faster than anyone) and bad (they now have to try gimmicky things like every other brand to stand out) which is not an &quot;apple thing&quot;😂<br><br>Let&#39;s see how the so called no.1 brand performs in this phase👀"
@athul070,"Bro I feel like nothing company will beat apple at this point 😂 <br>Iam using nothing phone 1 from 2 years ago with the snapdragon 7 Series processor costs around $360 this phone is so smooth,lag free I can&#39;t wait for the phone 3"

@Me-zx7kk,Apple will struggle to stay relevant by iPhone 20
@Minigrub,“Turning point moment” I have a busted 13 pro and this still wasn’t good enough for me to upgrade Apple has become a totally pathetic company

@MrRelevance02,This died on launch
@humanprojector,Can&#39;t wait for the horizontally stacked camera lenses on the iPhone 19.
@ThankGod_Dk,Android user who will still watch it regardless.
@orien2v2,"If the line is drawn from here for Apple Intelligence, everybody can toss their current iPhones down the drain. AI is now integrated into the core apps and for all future updates so not being able to use it basically means all ios devices are neutered or should I say circumcized. Best to sell them now before 16 comes out. Yes even 15 will be limited simply because Apple decided A18 will be the one for AI being built from the ground up for it, and not A17."
@raptorrex,Pretty colors tho
@KoalaBeer.,I still can’t leave Samsung one ui 7 might offer more. iOS colour pallet is ugly as what a mess 😂 . Samsung better .
@tobee1k,"I think Apple has failed to understand what actually makes people excited to upgrade - it&#39;s when there is a radical step forward in design. iPhone 4, iPhone 6, iPhone X, iPhone 12: these are the iPhones that people were excited to upgrade to because they felt like genuine leaps forward. The iPhone 12 came out four years ago, and aside from some fairly useless AI features and camera improvements (that will do very little for most users) this feels like essentially the same phone (again!). I have a 12 Pro, every year I look at the new iPhone launch and see nothing that excites me - nothing to make me hand Apple more money. Apple have got me well and truly in their ecosystem, so it&#39;s too much hassle to switch to Android, but in terms of design, Samsung&#39;s clean lines are much more appealing. Unless Apple pushes the design aspect of iPhone 17/17 Pro more significantly than just a couple of mm less bezel, I suspect they&#39;re going to find their sales declining."
@rahuldasgupta5996,iPhone 16 Pro variants are nothing more than iOS version of S24+. Both have the same bezel thickness.
@CREED593,Bro you got a lot of phones<br>Plz give me one 😢
@vipul0,"Not much upgrade,  S24 ultra is still better"
@tidjaniimad5932,the main question doest it pause in the video ?
@ExTern-nl4ov,What did people expect? I dont understand the disappointment. Its the same slight improvement as every year.

@CoachD77,"I was a big Apple user until about three years ago, I added the S22 Ultra and then eventually the Pixel 7 Pro. Glad I stepped outside of the Apple ecosystem as there is not even innovation with their phones, I hope iOS 18 gives it a lift. So basically, the 16 series is the same as the 15 series. Yep, sticking with my iPhone 14 Pro and Android devices."
@youngangelscircle,Apple 😂lacks for innovation

I found it very ergonomic and it gave me an idea that I thought would be great: make the flat volume rocker touch sensitive and give it SCROLL FUNCTIONALITY!! I always thought scrolling with my thumb on the side of the phone would be so much easier and more ergonomic, instead of scrolling on the screen, especially when your reading a long document. Apple has finally done something similar albeit only for the camera. I&#39;m sure the scroll function can be coded in in future updates."

No wonder I tapped DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CHANNEL"
@akshaibabu3803,@mrwhosetheboss am asking U mr influencer being one of the main tech guy on youtube did u ever speak about the greenline issue or motherboard issue  faced by iphone users. Did u ever? Did have have any shame promoting a product or company which is robbing us. We are investing our 4 or 5 months salary which we get from hardwork. Which we earn with all the shouting from our employees the stress our sweat. And after 2 months a update which is provided by the company itself and after that the diaplay is done. And the biggest scam is when we go to the apple store they know what is the problem still they charge us a diagnosis test charge and after that to repqir our phone we have to give half of the phones price ( the iphone doesn&#39;t fell down from my hand it doesn&#39;t fall on water it&#39;s damage is provided by the company itself and they charge us again to resolve it what a nonsence) and top guys like u have nothing to say about this. Sorry bro am a big fan i like ur videos am a subscriber. I watched everysingle video u posted  and i bought an iphone becouse of u after months keeping and always clean and protecting it like a little child its gone. Its not practical people like us to reapir it again saving 2 months salary so if u have any commitment agnist ur subscribers speak up stop promoting this robbers.

@hkgamma,"Did 16 improved a lot compared to 15? No. Is that a bad thing? It depends. If you are the type that upgrades EVERY time a new iphone comes out, then yeah, it&#39;s bad. If not, no, it&#39;s very good. It&#39;s stupid to own a 15 and be mad that 16 is a very small upgrade. Just stay with 15 (or 14 or even older), and upgrade when you feel that your phone is not ok anymore. I&#39;m on 7 plus (yeah... 7), and it&#39;s still ok. Sure, battery is old and it doesn&#39;t hold so much, and ios is starting to get deprecated, but anything else is still ok. I hope that 17 will get rid of the notch/dynamic bullsh*t..."

@asherrichardson3449,Can we get a camera test for the pixel 9 pro XL and the iPhone 16 pro max
@GxtMo,Damn there just got the 15
@Izzo250,I&#39;ve never been bored of a Mrwhosetheboss before🤦🏾‍♂️<br><br>Nothing exciting about these phones at all.

@kostasrebas6572,Yeah because everyone has an Apple vision pro without a pro phone

@Mandy0monday,I’m looking forward to your battery test
@user-tr7ut7ei8s,"Even if u gifted me a iphone 16 pro max, I will sell it and get the s24 ultra"
@amoghdeshpande443,Can we use the action button(space) and convert it into 3.5 mm jack. Are we really saving the space for the battery by adding more buttons? 🤔🤔
@MaxMiller94,I&#39;m convinced they&#39;re shipping AI features later specifically so they won&#39;t be included in reviews. Neither you nor any member of the press will be able to tell people whether Apple&#39;s AI is just as useless and broken as every other company&#39;s.

@mariusr221,"Everyone worked overnight and you guys pulled it off! Congrats for a very detailed video on the topic iphone 16 / 16 Pro!<br><br>I have a few ananswered questions though:<br><br>Why in the world of God didn&#39;t they upgraded the Telephoto camera to 48MP or make all cameras 48MP? Macro photographyis nice, but I will take 1-2 photos per month maybe...The rest of the photos will be with the main or telephoto camera, just like all the other earth-dwelling humans!<br><br>Why keep the old 12 MP front camera? If you want to take a selfie with all your friends at the table you end up with a washed up photo... And it&#39;s not like they have Google Pixel&#39;s &quot;Add me&quot; feature to bring you in a good qualitative photo. <br><br>Yes, they have a few nice features like the camera control button or the nice new bezels but the ones above are just bad decisions from my point of view."

@DeshiDudesYT,He saying THE OLD IPHONE and should iphone x series is kinda insult to me 🫠
@amasahmed7900,Now I just feel like apple just keeps on pushing same things with different colours and finishes. Each year they just say &#39;50 percent&#39; this and &#39;20 percent&#39; that. And people keep buying them
@JedidiahRoshanJeremiahStpatric,i was surprised that the iphone 16 got the camera button. i think they should have just given it to the pro

The 15 (base) had an ultra wide and a main lens, but the main was 48mp so it could do 2x zoom without relative loss AND apple put it up on heir website as &quot;optical&quot; zoom. Here in the 16, they changed the ultrawide to 48 mp so it can work as a norm lens and put in a 2x zoom lens. Like bruh isnt that just new branding to fool people when it is realisticallity the same thing. and I know that the 16 will be better than the 15, BUT it will mainly be due to the new chipset and apple focusing more on the software of the 16 than the 15 to justify getting the 16.

We got 90hz from OnePlus (which by the way was still a small and considerably new company) in somewhat 2018/19. Getting this absolutely unnecessary camera button over high refresh rate is simply dumb. I can already see it being flushed in the future, like the 3d touch."

@sherwinmendoza1221,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=382"">6:22</a> what game is that?"
@MoZiyad,Apple&#39;s designers are the ones who are really lucky. They get paid so well not to change anything but make some very basic minor updates based on their old designs. And it feels like they&#39;ve really hit the dead end with what they can do with the Pro models.
@opggaurav931,Your 19.4 and apple 19.6😅😂
@paritoshgautam,"I laughed my ass off hearing them talk about gaming performance, AAA titles and ray tracing while still being stuck on 60Hz on 16"
@harveyhandog8736,Me Too There No is Thermal Pads
@Open-dreams,Touch button is not handy
@deepakrana7949,Okay looks great. Please send one phone gift for me. thanks in advance.
@NdrsOrs,I will wait real comparison between 16 pro and 15 pro. Want to upgrade my 12 pro
@troublemaker4lyf,Jerry rig….
@mba9565,apple did everything on the iPhone 16 that was not a necessity but still did not upgrade 60hz which everyone has been asking them for years
@tatendamagombe1998,Apple turning of comments is messed up kkkkk Tim Cooked
@cey3205,does iphone 15 pro max also get the apple intelligence ?
@fcvb1236,This year&#39;s AE really shook me as they were trying to convince that its better that the competitor which is cheap for a company like apple
@CrazyMantriOfficial,I kinda knew that we were not going to get any special features from Apple. They are still living in 2020 whereas Samsung and Google are just giving the features from the future. Still Disappointed though!!!
@beebeedeeie,The only thing odd about the iPhone 16 is why the flash is just off to the side not inside the camera grid
@AaronEmerald,I have been telling myself im going to upgrade from my 12 pro for the last 3 years and every year it gets pushed back due to the lackluster new models. Only thing im really missing out on is 120hz but im okay for now
@Refaelgez,Is that Pokéball ring?! Respect!😊
@kcode.codeandtech,I can&#39;t afford the new iphones but it never stopped me from watching the new phones 😂😂
@reboot1337,"im 13 pro max user and i actually like new 16 pro max, better camera, I hope sick battery life and I&#39;m into ai stuff, its probably hard to upgrade from 15 pro max but same time you always get money back from your old iPhone so you kind of already have money in anyway"
@tabishbaloch2043,Why apple is sticking with only one design for the last 6 years  😡😡😡
@SamHe-nm8sz,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=671"">11:11</a> &quot;it makes the phone look CUTTING EDGE&quot; your puns can&#39;t hide from me Mr Boss"
@Donalob,Why would anyone buy these phones? They are massively overpriced.
@FilianAfterHours,I would get an S24 but pictures are so saturated
@kavinab6629,Nah I&#39;m done with apple. Will stick with my samsung fold 6
@mastergamingvt5385,you will never get beauty and smart together
@beebeedeeie,Posting at midnight? why actually there shouldn&#39;t ever be a reason
@bass3657,🥱😐
@SimonRockman,"In what world was double light press thought to be user-friendly and discoverable? Finger gymnastics is the right term. These phones are iterative. Better cameras, faster cpus. Things like a new ceramic coating, better thermal management, camera positioning, and reduced bezel sizes should be running changes. There is absolutely no innovation in these phones. Everything is “more and better” or “faster”.  The ESR case seems more innovative than the phone it surrounds.<br>What next? More buttons, perhaps on the front, below the screen?<br>If you look at the vision Pro every aspect of it is new and innovative. It is a leap ahead of Oculus. The vision Pro has been game changing in the industry. <br>What makes this Apple laziness so dreadful is that if Apple isn’t trying, then its rivals don’t try so the whole market slows down. And there is an important core feature that never gets mentioned. How well does it work on a mobile network? How good is the radio performance? If  Apple is crowing about thermal management and ceramic coatings it’s probably safe to assume that the antenna and radio performance is nothing special. So here is a phone which is a cynical marketing spin, and which doesn’t perform particularly well as a phone."
@markc6714,I&#39;m so sick of the AI hype
@DmanDmax,"So Apple is just now catching up, but everyone will pretend like it reinvented the wheel again."
@0609kenji,All these comments 😂 samsung literally does the same thing. With their flagships. Period.
@ZhenisAstana,"First time wathcing you. Well done,  I am impressed. 👍"
@user-py8st4tq8v,Say hi to Carter pc
@andree010,"I am getting iPhone 16 now. Not because it’s so great but I am so used to Apple that I can’t swap, and my current iPhone is old and tired. That’s not the best reason to buy from iPhone customer’s perspective."
@mitchellbobby3999,"okay i used to call you an apple rider before, but seeing this honest review.....is definitely the way to go."
@AndiWand911,Mute switch &gt; Action Button. Change my mind. 😂
@kenmarcvc,👄
@ferryhmm,"Incremental features add up. Almost no one upgrades on a yearly (or every 2 years) basis anymore. Personally I come from an iPhone 11, so this will be a huge upgrade"
@_cartijay_,hardly even changed
@MaunyBabaSanyasy,1. 100x zoom ❌<br>2. Call Voice recorder ❌<br>3. Irritating dynamic Island notch removed ❌<br>4. Downloading videos from various websites ❌<br>5. Multiple Tasks performance ❌<br>6. Google lans Android phones are using for last 5 years which iphone introduced now. 😂<br>7. Apple Map worst<br>8. Multi options of Editing in photos and videos ❌ android ✔️<br><br>Wait for Samsung phone for Fab 25 With extra features.
@Inksploded,"HOW THE HELL do pepole buy apple shit, the company would be dead in a universe where pepole had a brain"
@harryisakitten7347,I hate that they made the Pro’s bigger without adding more battery juice (200 mHZ is basically nothing.) I liked the size of my 11 a lot but find it a bit laggy so I was wondering if I should upgrade to the 15 pro or the 16 pro. Now I’m am stuck between choosing a heating pad or a slightly undersized brick… :(
@stewartclark8896,"Wow, I&#39;ve had 4k 120 frames on my OnePlus 9 pro forever... So innovative 😒"
@VirKap99,"They went from round edges to sharp edges with the Iphone 4, then back to round with the 6, changing it to sharp again from 12 onwards. Now they went back to the Iphone X camera arrangement and mudule shape."

@rageekyfootball5608,Apple has more subs now 😅😅
@adeshreuben,Another bad phone. It should sell for under 40k to be a decent phone.
@theobserver3753,Samsung has something to copy next year
@karanjoshi2662,Remember when the draw of iphone was just one button is all you need.
@mohd4kheel,"60hz , 🤢"
@Lukey-jy4ez,Apple should switch to rolling out a new phone every 2 or 3 years. We will get over it.
@Freehout,So basically a different camera placement for the base iPhones (which isn&#39;t even different) and new colors. 😂😅
@Inksploded,PEPOLE STILL BUY IPHONES? They are shite
@johndogbe1428,Arun ...pls get your face checked. there is a tilt to the right muscles when you talk which is more pronounced.  apologies if maybe I&#39;m just wrong.
@kanusolomon2449,Thanks for the info
@lowkeygaming4716,This is now the best time to buy the 15 pro max. waiting for reasonable price drops
@Inksploded,Apple is a shit company
@prashantapal5055,iPhone 16 looks more good than iPhone 16 pro
@reda497,I love the new camera button and what it is capable of. Keep your opinions to your self.
@HeLithium,Switched back to android after 5 consecutive years of using iPhone (11pro to 15pro). I plan to come back when they do something special about this product line or give norm iPhone high refresh rate screen😂

@princebanini,Big moment for the 7 people who own the vission pro!! come on Arun you didnt have to do apple like that😂😂
@neparaboy4135,I can&#39;t  afford iphone 6 😢 but my dream is iphone 19 ultra pro max in future 😂😂
@afssorkhan5065,iPhone turned 16: getting old my friend!!!
@AndrewHahaLee,"If the future of smartphones is just a future for AI, then count me out. I&#39;ve been spoiled with the triple one-inch 50MP sensors on my XM14U that is near noiseless at night without processing and nightmode, plus near lossless on zoom cropping. On top of it, I also got further spoiled by the 1-inch sensors on my brother Vivo x100 Pro. Chinese smartphone tech has given me drastic impressions how Samsung, Google and Apple are nearly 2 generations old at this point. Being able to charge from 10% to 50% in 15mins on those 2 phones is also a quality of life improvement I&#39;ve come to accept as the new normal."
@saurabhrana6459,That camera button is useless
@zakirhussain2266,Same shit no innovation at the moment Honor is doing something better
@user-pf4zb6bv9e,"Remember people, you pay the brand and the hype"
@JeevanPradhanG1,Apples camera button: revolutionary <br>Sony camera button: hold my Xperia 😂
@ThePhimanuBeats,"Its really disappointing that Apple did not manage to launch Apple Intelligence in the EU. If you take all the AI stuff away, its a really small upgrade once again"
@Conannnnn,That marine Color should have been on the pros. It’s nice. But other than that it’s the same phone as last year.
@elijahkolawole8329,"&quot;Most IMPRESSIVE&quot;<br>&quot;Biggest YET&quot;<br>&quot;Longest LASTING&quot;<br><br>I heard that last year and the year before that. Maybe the year before that year, I definitely can&#39;t forget about the year before that other year."
@Novato369,120
@SmokeFFM,So happy I don&#39;t have to buy expensive Apple Sh... for my GF on X-Mas this year 😅😅
@stefanosalariace,Where was this energy when samsung dropped the same phones for the last 3 years lol. We cannot expect revolutionary things every year…..I think tech companies should release their product every 2 years. The best thing about the event was the airpods 4
@shaikhmushaf1939,Nowadays People are understanding apple’s marketing strategy and not buying iphones every year
@nathanjayrog,128gb is more than adequate for 95% of iPhone users.
@md.nazmulhassan9505,Finally you are here. I was hoping for some reactions from you earlier.
@johnhowellseroje4995,Basically iPhone 15 pro max ultra giga Chad sigma
@micaiahjock8565,Well can an Itel user give an honest opinion?😂🤚
@jibrindanladiliam9198,That button could have been a fingerprint reader...
@nowderly,"Buy 16 pro good if you have 13 pro or older, but 14 pro and 15 pro pro are good right now and you don’t need to upgrade. 16 sh t phone you will better to buy 15 pro with better cameras, titanium and also pro motion. Leakers says iPhone 17 regular will get pro motion so then it will be good"
@I_Trade_Negative_RR,Such a shit iPhone. I won’t be upgrading
@madhavkumar6463,Apple getting out of ideas
@Shutterjourneys,Worth upgrading to 16pro from 13?
@GrandMaster-7-,If you want to open an &quot;app&quot; 🤫 and it calls your Mom.. Thats a sister not an Assistant.
@zaidbaig2943,Could you review something more interesting like Huawei tri fold
@edgarsnezinu1439,"Well 😂 lack of design and lack of ideas with another year... I skiped 14,15 and i guess 16 model too"
@NoobTarif2211,Well arun you just lost to apple on subscriber count.😅 hope that big iphone didn’t just trash around.
@frostyfly31122,"tbh, i really hate camera bums, i wish that manufacturers just made the phones uniform so they can lie flat properly and have better balance when propped up, like they can use that increased depth for additional battery which will always be welcomed imo."
@vikashanand623,"Well, as soon as the new iphone launched, my old phone started hanging 😅"
@stefannicic6509,"My question is ... Aside for almost 7 inches screen and only about 5h of battery life - according to official spec page, why should anyone get pro max this year? It doesn&#39;t even have an edge over zoom like last year. And storage it comes with at base price is not much of justification."
@Lukey-jy4ez,That camera control button - gong to work with a phone case? Does not look like it will
@lans8211,Hey just let you know you and your team have my full support and I hate but to point out you do know apple channel will get a boost on its follower numbers when there’s an apple major event right? It’s okay that we wait a bit more on that video. Keep it up 😎
@Sorry_ImTruthful,I’m that customer apple  is talking about? And nothing was shown that looked “revolutionary” to abandon my iPhone X 🤷‍♂️
@unauthac1193,Why is there so much salt here?<br>People don’t understand the sheer power of the chips we have today..
@acewex,Again a year where I don&#39;t nett to upgrade my Galaxy S23 U to an iphone. No feature impressive enough to let me even think: you absolutly need that iphone!
@Rudraiya,Over engineered mess 🚮
@crawker,Same shit every year...not worth it.
@kollvall,I like the sneaky Marques Brownlee recording :D
@houserhythm,It’s called a “pro” so it should actually be focused on the “industry professionals” as you say. Average Joe should be getting the non-pro phone.
@lordcharfield4529,"I used to buy a new phone every year. When I had the 7 (pro max, I think), I waited until the 12 (pro max). I basically decided with the 7 to only change when I absolutely had to because what I’ve always found is that even with a 5 year jump, there’s very little difference on a day to day basis between old and new! All of the ‘fluff’ that comes with a new release is smoke and mirrors yo me as an average iPhone user."
@simardmg,si thi s guy will say iphone 16 with 60hz is better than pixel
@awekeningbro1207,so they literally added chatGPT inside iphone and called it revolutionary?
@jasonseow89,Charging more than $200 for a 60hz phone in 2024 should be a crime punishable by law
@masoomimasoomi8514,lol u forgot the 16 pro max 😛
@manishbalam,Why are you toxic
@bunnatang2081,I viewed this video  just to make you have more views though new iphone is making less sense to upgrade

@plamenlipchev,"This iPhone feels like a fail for me, alot of people don&#39;t care about AI, including me which makes over half of the features on this new phone useless for most people, the camera button as Mrwhosetheboss said is just plain useless most of the time.

@Indrid__Cold,"How can they, in good conscience offer storage options like 128gb on a phone without an SD card slot. Storage has become so cheap that this is unconcionable. It&#39;s like selling you a full size car with a 3 gallon petrol tank."
@forgodani,When are people gonna say &quot;enough&quot; for nothing innovative? Instead of buying the same phone every year...
@mdasham3723,I don&#39;t think apple gonna sustain for so long it might be due to there lack of innovation and sticking to there <b>PRO</b> <b>NON PRO</b> agenda doesn&#39;t listen to there users..They should really take a rest time for atleast 2-3 years to comeup with new devices load those devices with newly innovative designs plus accomodating with what&#39;s useful features are what are not.. I know there stocks and everything might hit badly but its gamble for them to really bounce back to there name apart from just launching same devices with new names..We can literally see the criticism Apple gets everyyear for not doing good for there users

@abishek9978,All these numbers just for the 80% users to scroll through Instagram and mails. The thing is that the base models have 60hz. So even scrolling isn&#39;t much fun there💀
@Nitu_S.C.,So there are no real big improvements. Just marketing &quot;technicalities&quot;. I think it is wiser for those who have 15 Pro to wait for the 17 pro version.

@freiteez,300million haven’t upgraded in 4 years. I have a 13 pro max and yet again see no reason to upgrade. Besides the $1000 incentives they have. Even those got pushed so a regular iPhone 12 can get $1000 to upgrade
@pooya.89,you know having double  standard is not good for a tech guy ... its ironic that you talked all that negative about iphone yet spend 50k on building a big iphone . if apple products are bad then try building an big s24 ultra next time and NOT iphone

@timaustin2000,4K at 120fps! Wow.... Like I&#39;ve had for 3 years on my Sony&#39;s.

@d_n_j6298,i dont know about usa and parts of europe but rest of the the world dont upgrade apple is not because they are waiting for more features but because it is really expensive specially with export tax and there is no system to upgrade by giving your older phone for a discount in many countries too

@sundarr7977,Shall I buy iphone 16 pro or wait for samsung 25 ultra? Any suggestions
@crasuswolf,Cowboy frog?<br>All influencers have the same imagination?<br>Apple edited for you all?😂
@somtongini7347,60Hz again is ridiculous
@camotech1314,Still only 60hz screen on the normal iPhones??  😆
@vzero8612,Apple: we make phones for dumb people
@ShazzadHasan-v2r,their new &quot;private&quot; AI seems like a privacy nightmare.
@EliteLucarioRS,I wonder how apple have abused right to repair this year😂
@shohruhbekergashboyev,They did it again. They&#39;ve managed to take the same exact phone and enhance it by 5%. Amazing. Mind-blowing.
@user-vm7ny7bh3e,So I’ll stick with my 11 pro max for another year.
@amoghparwatkar,Built from the Ground Up😂
@benjaminblakemore9704,WHY LAUNCH WHEN YOU NOT READY EGGS 😂❤
@two_wanderedsouls,So basically they r copying samsungs ai features. If samsung copied the software gimmicks all tech youtubers would say that but apple pays a lot to all tech youtubers so they keep their mouth shut about apple &amp; praise them in a big way for the very little things changed on a 1000 $ 1500$  phone
@fluffy126,Rather stay with my 13 pro max🥱
@Shinjo_Ms,"Unfortunately the changes feel way too incremental. They focused so much on Ai stuff that it kinda took away from everything else. Visually the phone looks the same since 12, features just have slight updates that don&#39;t radically improve anything. Plus their AI features don&#39;t really bring anything new, nor are they usually used by users anyway on a day to day basis."
@louvenio7413,60hz HAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHA 100$ phones have 90 hz nowdays
@RedRebel008,"Here are my views on &quot;Apple Intelligence&quot; -<br>Genmoji - Love it, I cannot tell you how many times I feel like I don&#39;t have the right Emoji.<br>New AI animations - This is just a Subjective design Choice, but these Animations look Mystical over Samsung&#39;s Simplistic ones.<br>Visual Intelligence - Basically &quot;Apple Lens&quot;, I&#39;m keeping this as a pro, just because its more polished than Google lens, and slightly, not much, just slightly more accessible.<br>Message Summary - Love that sh!t, I&#39;m one of those guys that doesn&#39;t read the text on notifications, just becasue I can&#39;t see the useful part.<br>Image/ Wallpaper Generation - Even Motorola has it now, there is literally nothing new about it.<br>Writing Tools - I mean, We have had that for literally a decade, if you use a G Board that is.<br>Priority Notification - Its great, but not revolutionary.<br>Siri - Now this is revolutionary, the only problem is, I don&#39;t trust Siri one bit, I&#39;m gonna wait for the full reviews before I judge it."
@johnadriancatoy3149,"Can I have Iphone 13 pleasee, the one with two camera&#39;s in the back.. i want to experience having an iphone"
@macosbyanthony896,IPhones look more like toys these days than tools. Keep your  iPhones 14 and 15. You don&#39;t need all those features. Know why you are buying that phone.
@Ikarussen468,Gemini seems still far better than Apple intelligence!
@comfortsibanyoni9523,The iPhone glazing is disgusting at this point.
@sunvetr,I want an iphone again but they need to get rid of dynamic island and stop manufacturing in china
@amernej,"They should’ve at least lowered the price, because this is just sad"
@satyajitmohanty4794,So boring
@JosiahReubenVillanueva,Another camera battle in like idk 2 weeks &quot;Apple Iphone 16 Pro Max vs Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra&quot; (imagine samsung still wins lol)
@SuyashKrishnaDas108,Literally nothing was new on the new iPhones!
@fluffy126,They gave us a third camera to wanna take it away and go back to two cameras.💀😂
@lememe1584,so it&#39;s a non-transparent nothing phone 1
@dholaholics,This phone is pointless unless your into all this camera bullshit.. what a real waste of money. I have the XS.. I wanted to upgrade to this.. Pro model but it’s not worth it
@loidforger4285,"So now I am confused, should i buy iphone 12 or 13"
@nafimkhan9462,Oh i love these youtubers every year. They bash the android phones like crazy but shill over the same iPhone every year. Fucking jokes
@MrEnoBeano,These are another minor upgrade scams.  I don&#39;t understand how people can keep buying these phones.  They keep selling the same phone every year.  Iphones are a money pit.  Same goes for Samsung and other companies.
@sampadkar19,"The shutter button is viable only when you have pro controls to change brightness, exposure, shuttet speed in camera app"
@Bu5H84,wow so much hype only to fall on its face
@zeathmesshinoda3898,60HZ in 2024??? 🤣🤣🤣
@MAYNE318,Apple every year. It such and such percent this and such and such p e recent that.  It&#39;s 17% faster or whatever.  You won&#39;t notice most of the percentages that they throw out there
@SleepyGolen,Autofocus on the normal phones is an actual game changer to those who use iPhones for recording
@ALi-1.1.0,Bro seems disappointed like all of us for this series.<br><br>I must say the iPhone Team Mr WhoseTheBoss made was better than all the iPhones combined of all ages
@macosbyanthony896,"Most people haven&#39;t upgraded their phones yet because there is no need for them to. I ask my customers why they are buying a new phone and they seem not to have enough good reasons to change. I use a Samsung S24 Ultra. Trust me, I do not use 90% of the features. All I need is a phone that can carry me throughout the day without worrying myself to charge. Well, I wouldn&#39;t deny my customers from buying to earn my commissions. Ghanaians are very rich. We buy not on credit."
@hammernz199,60hz.....Welcome to 2020
@salamsarat,I wonder when you &quot;Tech gurus&quot; are going to start scolding Apple for the scams that they put out for 3 or 4 years now. Or the money is just that good ?
@ohenemosespharsttee1202,Arun&#39;s tone alone is enough to tell you how boring the iPhone 16 series are 😂🤓
@MR_Razon,Me Actually Confused about whats the difference betweens iPhone 11 and 16.
@rkivlogi,"Still no update to the selfie camera? Well, I guess not many people using those in 2024 🤷‍♀"
@naqib643,"While I do agree with you on most of the points, I wouldn&#39;t be criticising the addition of new features considering that&#39;s been what Samsung and others have done since the beginning of the smartphone era."
@DavidThomas658,"RIP my Iphone 6,  you have served me well..."
@mwboost,Phones are at a.. meh... Level. Besides ai. <br>Not sure why people bitch between or carry on about phones still. That many good options now at a top level with little between them all.
@thecharliegeorge2151,Presenter gaslighting that the 16 I’d different
@freydough3178,Damn how dissapointed thats it ohhh boy
@nashlib,This Apple event was 30% more underwhelming than previous. With 50% more fluff than the previous. 45% of not so great features. And 10% of great features which won’t work in 85% of the exiting phones. <br><br>I think we better start calling a spade a spade ♠️ <br><br>Let’s all grow some spine. <br><br>Demand for real innovation for the 100% hard earned money that we pay Apple. <br><br>Steve would have had this entire Apple team for breakfast and still gone on to blast them through lunch and dinner.
@benjaminblakemore9704,SAMSUNG RULES!!!
@fjmorales6823,yyyyeah also I think I am just switching my iPhone 12 battery
@danielkirk5660,Why is everyone saying Fruity for everything now?
@TechGamesAU,Still no 120hz iPhone is such a failure.
@markjco3515,This is more like a software update more than a redesign
@billypodol9006,Thank you Apple for making Android better!😂<br>Does the non-Pro versions have 120 hz screen ? No!❤😂🤢<br>We switched last years from physical buttons to screen buttons and gestures etc. and now go back to the future .
@felixryan9798,"Y&#39;all saying as if the S24 changed anything from the S23.<br><br>Phones have matured enough to not require a radical change every year, and you have a CHOICE not to do do every year."
@Pookytroll,"The majority of the ppl here never used an iphone or cant aford one, the iphone it is also a prosumer camera, the raw files are great to edit on adobe lightroom, the pro res files give a lot of flexibility, many people use the iphone for content creation, u have final cut camera that can sync the camera output of 2 phones and record or stream it. The 15 was lackluster, the 16 pro looks good. Ppl use these phones at more then u guys think, that being said ppl also use 1400 dolars phones just for consuming social media."
@ashenisuranga2915,"Add a button, you get blamed. dont add a button you get blamed for not adding anything new 😅😅"
@LoganAIexander,"Bro they should have kept the diagonal camera it was so iconic and unique to Apple, the colors r nice though i thought theyd be so ugly"
@benjamin8876,Apple is the master of percentages that no one can properly check
@Blue-Bruw,It&#39;s crazy that iPhone 16&#39;s type-c port still only supports up to USB2.0
@sampadkar19,Why 120Hz is not a Hero Feature
@r0dnee,Laziest design team ever
@Samuel-qe9lj,Appreciate the honesty about the gimmicky camera button... Seen review getting super excited for that button 😂
@subhajitsen7601,"Nobody is pointing out the problem of the Camera control button. If a vlogger vlogs through rear camera, then there will be a problem of mis_Touch. Isn&#39;t it????"
@copiousfootnotes,Now you&#39;ll have to redesign your giant iPhone.
@markhyde1970,Trying to catch up with Android again!
@thesoftspottss9080,Here is the same phone 16!😅
@the_bozixs3255,"Aple has once again surpassed you in subscribers and once again, the battle of surpassing apple starts."
@jancoscholtz,Some tech guy must interview Tim Cook one day and ask all these questions nose on… <br>Like Siri that use to be able to answer questions instead of just “what I found on the web” prompt. And now suddenly redesigned the wheel with “Apple Intelligence” where she answers questions……. Like what it use to be 7 years ago. <br>Sure AI is good… but the deliberately dumbified Siri of the years to make this reveal feel larger
@PiyushSagar-rj5xs,CMF Phone 1 camera design 😂
@harisankard1404,"So, the iPhone 15 fused with the iPhone X = innovation."
@EXOTIC_YK,Apple has more subscribers than you
@atulkadam8644,Pixel line up is way better this year
@lolmonstazoriginal4841,60hz screen in 2024 is beyond wild
@r0dnee,They&#39;ve been making the same phone since the 10
@Androidguy15,Bro I commented yesterday day that you are gonna do a review on the t iPhone 16
@user-eq3vq7rn8d,Remember Congo. You don&#39;t need a new phone
@mrtroublemaker3308,I have only 4 $ what should I do now 😢😢😢
@KevyD77,"Typical Apple being Apple. Inventing their &quot;revolutionary new ideas/technology&quot; which Android phones have been doing for years already and they&#39;ve just renamed it 🤣 <br>Apple Intelligence, AI? What a joke. Fanbois are lapping it up too."
@crossybreed,Let&#39;s get this guy 20M subscribers
@Riptide900,What apple forgot to mention is that this is another bullsh*t phone which has been repetitive for forever !
@cbee402,"At this point, we know apple as a whole is a social experiment."
@ImranShaikh-hu1ez,Hmmm nothing here .. actually
@TechGamesAU,The marketing must have been so bad I didn&#39;t even know there was going to be an iphone event today and I usually follow these things.
@deRykcihC,&quot;These don&#39;t cater to normal users&quot;<br>guess what the Pro in iPhone 16 Pro means??
@arifmammadov736,1 hour spent on talking about incredible innovative colours. OMG 😱
@prakhar.29december,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=259"">4:19</a> As a company that reserves its new features for its Pro model in the maiden year &amp; trickles it down to the non Pro model the next year, I think the Camera button, for this year, could have been reserved for the Pro lineup. It is indeed a bit Pro level thing for a smartphone to have a dedicated Camera button with so many functionalities hidden inside it &amp; it could have been a distinctive feature to separate the Pro from the non-Pro models. Non-Pro already got that Action button this year.. it was enough for that. If anything, Apple should have given 120Hz to 16 &amp; 16Plus while upgrading 16Pro &amp; 16Pro Max to 144Hz. They messed up."
@st-kr7fx,"apple is trailing behind doing AI thing which samsung did last year plus dat future on scrolling its been done by blackberry ,nothing new hear.....disapointing"
@griffin_faust,"If Steve Jobs were still alive, I believe Tim Cook might be scolded and  would face criticism about the iPhone&#39;s design and aesthetic."
@weekendwarrior8179,They all start at 128GB except the pro max. It&#39;s ridiculous to charge those prices for that.....
@Joshua-lk7zw,Can you do a camera comparison with the s24 ultra plsss?
@harpingon,"I was convinced you were going to say the whole presentation was shot on the new Pro Max phone , but alas!"
@zokashi9887,We got iphone 16 before GTA 6
@trungvu-2714,People just love to make fun of Apple. Still they&#39;re the best selling smartphones in the world
@thesoftspottss9080,I cannot belive how hypnitized apple customers are!!!😮😂😂
@Samuel-qe9lj,That camera button is a gimick lol
@HardyMan-sj3qd,Watching on my iPhone 25 pro 😊
@yorha.a2,16 minutes just to say nothing changed
@two_wanderedsouls,The 15 looks better somehow the diagonal camera layout looked better. This looks like a cheap chinese android phone
@emonty62,still childish Slo Mo.

@ChannelOasis,Apple copying<br>Design: Xiamo 11<br>Camera button: Sony xperia
@TisDoppel,I wonder if they’ll go back to diagonal cameras for the iPhone 20… big change
@zackvyle,nice to see the same phone with new number. it gets old nowadays.
@thatguy5192,I have never been so uninterested in a new phone before
@d_n_j6298,90% of people are right handed and the action button is on the wrong side still
@harisankard1404,"I&#39;m calling it... Apple is soon going to rename a set of older phones and sell it as the next generation without any changes, charger, cable, sim injector... And people are still going to buy it for some reason!!"
@kysewo,Apple just gets away with making the same phone for the last 4 years
@merenwen_kiltæsir,Oh good 😅 I can finally upgrade to 15 pro spending less now.

@newphonexp,Can wait to buy iPhone 15 thanks apple
@E36Paradise,Camera button. Sony came out with it first but apple improved it after like 10years?
@thesoftspottss9080,Why are talking abut &quot;action buttons&quot; in 2024?! Unbeliveble🤢
@danielg7216,The pixel 9 is a 6.3 in phone with a 48 megapixel 5X....
@Samuel-qe9lj,"I don&#39;t see any any difference, it just an S model, but they know if they inserted 15s, people will stay away"
@kbboy101,"Apple is saying...best iPhone yet because even they know it is not up to the competition so the best way is to compare it with its older self. Unless I had a 4-year-old phone that I had to upgrade anyway, I do not see anything substantial in the iPhone 16 Pro Max to make me want to buy it."

@fraggystyler,Did it occur to you that not every person on earth takes photos in order to post them on some social media site but instead to just archive them as a personal memory?
@Indrid__Cold,The &quot;action button&quot; is actually the old &quot;home button&quot; of years past. Now rearranged to encourage dropping your device.😂🔄
@KLP36912,Apple hit dead end on development.
@chimbudu,Waiting for the legendary Battery test
@alrasub,It was the most disappointing apple event ever! Apple is getting shit
@Winter_Nova,60hz ? that&#39;s slow. even low range android have 90 hz bruh
@TARNISH_,iphones are getting close to the functionality of an android
@simranjeetsingh5632,soooooo nothing new 🙂‍↔️
@aeonturnip2,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=679"">11:19</a> Huawei Mate 20X from 2018 had a 7.2&quot; screen - I still have one (although it&#39;s not my daily driver), and I still love it and wish another manufacturer would bring out a phone the same size again.  This is a good sign from Apple."
@twilightmedia8575,Now I will wait for the s25 ultra
@mandobaron,"I’m curious about filming everything in 120, won’t that mess with your shutter angle when viewing in 24/30p? Or is Apple compensating somehow?"

@fjmorales6823,“big moment for the 7 people that own one of them” lmfaooo
@jrelitedk1814,I hope the 16 pro doesn&#39;t heat and degrade the battery as fast as it does on the 15 pro. Its sad they Fked up again making the 16 with only 60hz. If it had 120hz it would be perfect. Im looking forward on seeing some battery testing. I also hope they make an update so the 15 pro doesn&#39;t heat up as much as it does now. My phone was at 100 for 6 months. The last 3 months im down to 95.........
@NavedAliKhan,Basically the pro series is trying to be a gadget for professionals just like the recent Sony phones
@SRKHD,"So, MKBHD traveled back for the event 😂😂😂<br>How many of you saw him in the video?"
@Unknown__,"It feels like Apple&#39;s shooting themselves in the foot with the lack of improvements over the last few years, its always the same thing, slightly better battery and slightly better camera. Samsung is getting better in every way and has cheaper phones. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if by 2030 Apple had gone bankrupt or lost a lot of money"
@chams2385,"Try to compare 15 pro max with 100% (brand new) bettery life with 16 pro max , to get fair result"
@KisaKnivez,I’m not switching iPhones until that notch is removed. The 12 does exactly the same thing as the 16 would all be it with some weaker specs.

@benjaminblakemore9704,"TOTALLY AGREE BRO, BORING AS LAUNCH! 😢😊"
@SahariyarAhad,Honestly they should at least add 120hz refresh rate at base model too. A phone with 700 dollar price tag having only 60hz refresh rate is a joke. Even 100 buck android has at least 90 hz

@caldwellwh,Looks like I will keep my iPhone 12 Pro Max a little bit longer. Don’t see a point to upgrade yet
@JMMinistries,"95% of people with iPhones uses the Camera on Auto, Uses iMessage, Watches YouTube, Netflix &amp; Scrolls Through Social Media. THATS IT!<br><br><br>NO NEED TO UPGRADE ANYTIME SOON! Unless, anything I mention above stops working or the phone isn’t getting iOS updates!"

@FurqatAbdulrazzoq,Every single weird &quot;innovation&quot; is a &quot;new&quot; technology when you are short of real creative ideas.
@marcoraydiaz,"To be honest this has to be the most mild and boring iPhone to date, but it&#39;s understandable - they&#39;ve already crammed every feature they could in the previous ones, now we&#39;ve gone from small upgrades to microscopic upgrades year to year. Bottom line - I&#39;m glad I bought the 15 Pro Max, this thing is proly gonna last me till 2030"
@maheshraju2044,We got iphone 16 before GTA6
@ryanlord,"As a photographer and im now getting into videography, i think i will upgrade from the 13 pro max to the 16 pro max as some of the new features are good for me as i know how to use them already from my camera ( and its much faster if i can colour grade my footage faster and also play with the audio faster and easier) if you are not a photographer/videographer then the upgrade is meh."

@kaushikmada,"I remember quite clearly how in some movies/TV series, they(apple fan boys) used to make fun of android phones cos they are just huge screens! The premise was that you&#39;re literally carrying a tv monitor with you. Funny how in 2024, that seems to be the direction apple has taken as well. Are y&#39;all finally accepting that android phones were right all along? If so doesnt that make your idea about 10 years out of date?"

@dayalvarma6461,Is this button use in gaming ?
@desmondLobo13,Me waiting for 120hrz on non pro series 👴

@johannesdolch,The Apple presentation was the most cringe thing i have ever seen. I literally felt like i was trapped in some dystopian nightmare scenario. I constantly had to remind myself that the people who think this is a good idea are some of the most powerful and rich people in our world. It&#39;s a complete joke. You think Zuckerberg talks like a robot? You haven&#39;t seen the Apple presentation. I can understand how people think those are lizard people with human masks.
@JJboy4Flower,I thinking to upgrade my current iPhone 14 Pro Max to iPhone 16 plus. Any suggestion?
@Texas_G_Longhorns,"The upgrade this year isn’t so much the phones, it’s the software and it’s free"
@michaelh8137,"Anyone else finally fed up of the lack of innovation? The whole colour designs etc, take a step back and look at what the iPhone used to be, vs the status icon it wants to be today.<br><br>First time in a while I’m considering moving away from their eco system"
@Gaurav-cy5lu,Billions of dollars in R&amp;D and the new feature is..... &#39;a Button&#39;.
@fsociety.dat101,"I know this is an iphone reveal, but I actually regret going from the s22 to the s24.<br><br>I&#39;d actually love to say nothing has changed, but the display has actually been downgraded.<br><br>I had both models next to each other, checked ALL display settings and yep, the s22 is much brighter and more colourful. I feel like I&#39;ve bèen ripped off in that respect."
@Patromax1,iPhone 16 is a disappointment
@kagamiuchiha1514,arun has become an apple fanboy.
@ameyakshirsagar4941,Why the smartphone market is so monotonous and saturated recently? I remember during 2018 every new smartphone would get people hyped up and every feature was loved by the people. I was always like Apple did this with their flagship it would be interesting to see what Samsung/OnePlus does next and every company&#39;s phones were unique unlike now. I totally understand how the cycle of things work but c&#39;mon companies don&#39;t let thirst of innovation die.
@Suhaibmukhtar12345,Watch all this from your Nokia son 🙂
@JuanD817,"Yeah... I&#39;ll just stay with my 15 Pro Max. I&#39;m not much of a camera guy so the new button is not that interesting for me and the 15PM is already going to be getting AI, so not that much new for me to consider upgrading to the 16. Let&#39;s see how next year&#39;s iPhone improves upon this"
@BellaB2B,iphone 16 pro color so similar to iphone 12 pro
@rex86uk,"The worst keynote ever, Apple somehow out do themselves every year. I shall be keeping my 5 year old series 5 for another year. Also all this Apple AI nonsense will just start to dumb down people more it’s actually scary."
@1soheb,so there&#39;s new color and much bigger battery (without any numbers)
@JuanD817,"Yeah... I&#39;ll just stay with my 15 Pro Max.

@lilzuplada1564,Nobody gives a a fuck about “spatial photos”. Nobody uses the vision pro. They’re clearly running out of ideas
@phillipa2346,"I would hope to see the new camera button be useful for other apps, adding more functionality. Such as now being able to have left and right bumper/trigger buttons when playing games."
@oneminutewonder77,It&#39;s absolutely wild that Apple get praise for eventually bringing camera features down to the regular model yet they have been hanging onto the high refresh rate on the pro models now for four generations. 60hz on a device is unacceptable in this day and age yet their customers still buy this crap
@aditsapkota7862,I can&#39;t believe Apple&#39;s hardware designers coming up to the conclusion of Two Action Buttons where they could&#39;ve combined it into one fairly easily.<br><br>It&#39;s like having two steering wheels (Yeah non-replacable ones) on your car one for normal use and one for track days. Simply ridiculous!
@noumeg7782,60hz on a 1000 USD phone in 2024. Wow
@nimzu4859,Waiting for the Iphone 16 vs galaxy 24 camera battle
@WA7K3R,dont tell me the f 16 is still 60HZ like why apple???

@sourabh_mandlik,I think we have reached peak of innovation in phones 4 years ago. there is literally nothing new which excites me to buy flagship phone. I have been using K20 pro since last 4  year it does everthing which a good phone should do and it only cost me 25000 INR.($297)
@Rashbains888,Either he wasn’t feeling well or he was so underwhelmed by this ‘New IPhone’….. correction definitely the later
@IdoGindes,Apple just passed Mrwhosetheboss in subscribers again 😭😭😭

@LiveLifeWithLove,Headphone jack would have been more impressive comeback than this new button.
@hamzaxcars,my 2 year old base model redmi note 11 has 90hz which is 7 times cheap than the iphone 16 pro max 128 gb

@abcabc-bu9wn,Hi Bixby!
@thomasasannes,No Apple intelligence in Europe. Probably not apples fault. But this makes all this AI stuff completely useless for most people outside of US. In most countries its not even planed for release next year. Why buy a phone with functions not available the next two years (or more).
@familyguyvideosforcontent1681,"Hi Mrwhosetheboss,<br><br>Since you have the brand new iPhone 16 for making this video. Is that phone yours or Apple gave it to you to make the video? I don&#39;t know much about tech YouTubers using the new iPhone and might need to return it back to Apple."

@krispcode,I always find it ironic that people are so quick to jump on the &quot;iphone doesnt change&quot; train when its the same with all phone manufacturers. All the change comes from the software.
@Sharpzee,im currently on the 13 pro max and was debating whetever to wait for the 16 release or go 15 and after the apple event and this video ill be going for the 15 pro max im not a pro photo person and the 15% cpu and 20% gpu increase isnt enough for me to go for 16 pro max over the 15 pro max

@ClassicRedEye,We are slowly going backwards away from touchscreen controls.  All they need to do now is put a finger print scanner inside of it and it will have the same features as the Note 9 did

@infinitees,Did they make it smaller or bigger this time 🤔
@wakecoalition3834,I bought s23 ultra last year. HW is ok. But ONE UI SUCKS. Charging SUCKS only 45W PD .. I bought it because of the extra S pen. It&#39;s really handy. My Samsung Tab S8 + however is horrible. And it loses its value like crazy in just about a year.  I&#39;ll never buy a Samsung tablet again.  I will switch to ipad pro once i save enough money.
@krispcode,"As a lefty, the action button feels great. And I am so happy for once that something is convenient for me."
@dindu42,I don&#39;t think the phone case manufactures are going to like all these new buttons. By the time they have created all the cut-outs for these buttons then it will be hard to retain a rigid structure.
@ighayinosayi,Now this has to be the most boring iPhone launch ever.<br>I didn&#39;t think they could top the 15 series launch

Is that what you guys see or are you just here to criticize and burn you @&amp;&amp; for no reason? I say it again, your Android doesn&#39;t even come close to Apple (I have used the S23 Ultra for a year). Let us all enjoy our times."
@CupofLoffee,As an iPhone user … this is just .. Samsung ? Haha
@ygwaltgmb,APPLE ADDED A BIXBY BUTTON 😂
@Haddypaddy98,Its actually a scam how they produce the same every year. But apple fans will always buy them so it will never stop.
@DjJay,So basically nothing new since iphone 11
@ArtVille927,UH OH Apple surpassed u by 200k again.😢
@andresmith1652,Why is the camera so important to them ? Why not improve messaging take a leap forward it’s 2024 start pushing the limits. No point in upgrading unless you just want to say I have the 16 🤷🏿‍♂️
@Golden200k,My s21 has all of that
@WorldGK2023,"Every year, they manage to fool us with their so-called innovative products."

@lonewalker9632,Apple intelligence won&#39;t be available in EU anyway
@taidee,"I honestly don&#39;t think these very devices need to change every year (except for people who buy to show off), I kind of like the keeping the same look, I see Samsung is doing it too now because the change on the outside doesn&#39;t really add to functionality on these rectangular slabs of glass. What we need are changes inside, and those happen on every iteration. Are we complaining that there are improvements? The cheat is the storage at this point, these phones should be starting @512GB now."
@Wayne_officail,Sticking with my 15 pro max 😂
@Morphed626,iPhones are officially boring for me now. They need a new form factor or something to make me give a damn
@DeChiel1st,You’re complaining about the business model apple is using for a long time.  Apple is not in a hurry to make the ultimate phone they always upgrade the phone just a little bit this goes on for years now.
@ryanhaley9407,iPhones are so far behind andoid that it blows my mind people still buy them. nothing new here. androids have had these features for more than a decade

@rahultanvir_me,$899 60hz display and 128 GB base storage in 2024 is really disappointing

@martinseal1987,&quot;I take all my photos in portrait&quot; said only Aaron 😂 psycho
@dannyjose87,"I think Apple maybe onto something with such massive focus on camera even in the base iPhone 16. Photos/videos have become a new way of communication with almost every socials app popularising it. Having a dslr’esque camera in your pocket is appealing to more people these days. <br><br>They must have tons of data that points to this trend. Possibly metrics such as number of people editing photos, trying manual controls, edited photos/videos being shared to socials. <br><br>Everyone and their mother is doing reels now. I think the megapixel war is not relevant any longer as most phone take great photos that are shared on socials and viewed on phones. People very rarely print photos. There has to be an edge to make more people buy iPhone over Android and Apple seems have their bets on AI and camera."

@ImKimo.,peasant? 😅
@ConnorPrice7325,hi
@chsrinivasreddy009,Same phones with complex jargon that’s all
@bernhardkoenigs2415,Not the Big Thing but it’s okay. I‘ll buy it.😂
@theclasherjon,Haha still 60hz and nothing new i phone is so sad hahhaah
@sian12,That Second Touch Button could have been a Finger Print Scanner adding an extra feature with whatever they wanted to add for Camera things.<br>Isn&#39;t it?
@Pk-glitch,How long has this been announced have I genuinely been this out of the loop?
@cyberlads28,How can they bring 60htz again… is taking its customers for granted…besides the ecosystem people should stop buying these base models
@Richard-ys2ns,I love how the only innovation since 2012 is higher resolution camera&#39;s and faster processors. Really makes watching YT on my phone a much better experience.
@neoqe6lb,BIG REVEAL: Wasn&#39;t this &quot;camera control button&quot; available on Apple Smart Battery Cases?? I&#39;m using iphone 11 with Apple Battery Case and I have the &quot;camera button&quot; on the case. Performs similar camera functions. I rarely use it as most of the times I&#39;m shooting vertically for social media content.
@alshahria3057,Me watching 60Hz i phone 16 in my 120Hz display Infinix Note 30 which is 1/10 of the price of i phone 😂

@Anotherdayanotherdollar473,&quot;Best battery on an iphone ever&quot; but no pro max iphone could beat my 13 pro max on battery life and i had 14 pro max and now 15 pro max and lets see what the 16 pro max can do 🙄

@MikeHenderson-tm1hs,After today&#39;s extremely underwhelming event. I am going to Hug my iPhone 15 Pro Max and Galaxy S24 Ultra tighter because those two phones were not a disappointment when they were introduce. The 16 Pro is the smallest yearly update in History and the Rumors for Galaxy S25 Ultra is not looking good at all either. So the 16Pro and S25 will be remembered as the worst updates in History.
@Tech-m7i,Can’t wait to get it 16 pro
@emmanuelokonkwo7049,The Siri calling my mum part was so true lol 😂 Siri has been due for an update for since
@Clovermovies-c3b,Apple overtook you
@Ahmed.Mezbah,How many people waited for his video???😊
@AnuragJbk,I think Apple should launch new phones once in 2 years with some actual upgrades.<br>Already too many similar iphones for the average user
@VIvaldi-gw4sb,Now we gonna see:<br>NEW Samsung Galaxy S25 ULTRA that can CAPTURE Videos at 8k 120FPS.
@MemeWorld122,Bro does not sound excited about these new iphones
@danielirvine7468,All I got out of this was some people use the button for fart noises on command <br>Genius!!!
@jockajocka,And I’m from a country that is not even listed as “next year” for apple intelligence.
@hooshm675,Well the iPhone 17 in 2025 will likely have a Vapour Chamber Cooling system like some Android smartphones to keep the phone from getting too hot🤔📱
@larryfy6394,Tbh I&#39;ll pick the giant iphone over the 16 series 😅
@laoualimamane125,"Thanks Arun for your honest impressions, can&#39;t wait to see the review now 😊❤"
@Remsnow,They&#39;re the same as every iPhone that comes out every year. Zero innovation
@crashpotato6388,Next year they gonna add touch ID functionality on that new camera control button 🤣
@111grafic,why did they skip A17 and named the new chip in 16 iphones A18 ? any idea
@CryptoTamil,Gonna stick with my 15 pro max till the 17pros comes out.
@swaggeryt6395,16 pro: new camera features <br>S25 ultra: hold my beer and let me cook.
@dragosi8980,"The way Apple does some stuff is why I could never be a fan of theirs. 60hz in 2025 is crazy. Think about it - some versions of the 16 plus will be way above 1000 usd, and for that you get 60 hz. That is unacceptable. <br>People will say &quot;oh most people won&#39;t notice it&quot;. Yes they will. Give a person who has had 120 hz for a while a 60hz phone and they will notice right away. Scrolling is somethinf everyone does a lot, and 120hz just makes it feel next gen.<br>Same thing for 128 gb base storage. On the pros too...are you kidding me? So you want us to film 4k 120fps (btw now 120 is suddenly important) on 128 gb storage? So you can fill your storage in like 10 minutes? This just feels so much like a ripoff, it would be logical to start with 256 at least on the pros...Never liked Apple for doing this..."
@lamsmiley1944,This was an extremely “meh” event
@blaz24,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=403"">06:43</a> thats why they were comparing iphone 16 stats to 4 year old phone in the presentation so much ☠"

@uddesh.m.sahadeo311,They missed yet another opportunity to add a fingerprint reader into the camera button tbh
@MrOrtmeier,The Pro is finally worthy of us name and is clearly a pro tool and no normal user should be buying a pro. It&#39;s overkill and wasted on a regular user
@Daniel-rw2gy,"How small are your hands bro lol, never had any problem reaching the action button.. and yeah I use it for a million things thru shortcuts like switching lights, turning computer on/off, orientation locking, flashlight, etc etc"
@ozzieman55,The Pixel 9 Pro just got even more attractive
@ultimateninja3x01,60hz on a phone in 2024 is exactly why im a proud Samsung s24 owner.
@iamdeanthemean,How badly do these tech content creators need to kiss Apple&#39;s ass? Calling a $800 phone that still has a 60Hz refresh rate as &quot;cutting edge&quot;!! LOL<br>One of the reasons Apple&#39;s influence continues to grow is the way YouTubers unfairly criticize decent products while relentlessly praising Apple&#39;s mediocre offerings year after year.
@thesecond4113,I&#39;ll wait until Iphone 20 then I upgrade.

@TheSinner23,"Still 60hz, WOW"
@Jansonsrob,"So get 15 pro, not 16 pro"
@Catani84,60Hz on a flagship in 2024? And especially from Apple? The iPhone really is targeted towards people that don&#39;t understand technology too much.
@sontranbich9257,They can just update the camera app to have those features to be swiped from edge of the screen. It is a gimmick again.
@xoyhcprivate,I am 18 years old. These camera features are not complicated. Why should apple dumb down their features?
@KatParks,Samsung is KING 👑
@ISuckAtGaming1126,its gonna be very hard to use the camera button if you add a phone case. i dont know what apple is thinking right now
@firstnamesecondname8280,Hating the AI stuff and makes me not want to get one.
@andreiionutcalin530,so nothing new the same shitt every year apple is crap they dont innovate at all is the same phone just  a new position on the camera and thats it no performance or ram  just features and software updates that can do on the old phone but wont not worth buying and still 60 hz display come one even cheap phones have at least 90 hz
@Gamewithandrewtz,the way that dude is struggling to use the camera button. i bet his thumb is paralyzed by now

@sbshn1839,You tech reviewers are so redecioulous!! If a company like Apple add some new features you say it&#39;s for industry pros and if they don&#39;t add anything you guys says it&#39;s just a copy/paste of last year line-up - What do you guys really want??

@barryturk5984,Aruns not impressed
@repsagcloks,"Honestly, I&#39;d much rather have an option to manually focus built-in...

@Harshvajani10,"The iphone 16 can run a game with Ray Tracing but only at 60fps though.. idk how that&#39;s an upgrade.. there are like 2 games that support Ray tracing but 100s of games that support 90 or 120fps that just would be locked at 60. I guess its the Apple way. Btw 2 minute silence for people who bought 15 plus who are stuck with a shitty processor, absolutely no AI and 60 fps😂"
@FedoraX2,Ngl.. by the time the base Iphones get 120 hz is when other premium phone brands use 360 hz.

@amandagqili9871,so ur telling me that it took years to make the iPhone 15 and now the iphone 16 just got announced that&#39;s just so stupid😑🙄
@DavidtheFoodie,Does anyone remember if the transferring of data from your old iphone to the new one will also bring over all photos and videos? Ty!
@DeRock401,The phones are out of ideas so they do what they can.  I’m still on the 14 pro max and was planning on upgrading this year.  Not sure if I plan on switching to android again. I’m waiting on Samsungs move. Although I am not trying to get rid of my Apple Watch and my AirPods so. Apple knows how to keep you locked in the ecosystem lol.
@user-mi8kb4ir4x,IMAGINE THE CAMERA SLIDER BUTTON REPORGRAMMED TO BE THE GAME BUTTON. Like to shoot in games. IT WOULD BE SUPER COOL
@dechend3198,I upgraded from iphone xr to iphone 14 plus recently and its fun to see people are buying iphone every year😂😂😂😂
@cipi8005,So you can&#39;t use the camera button with a case?
@owendyer6583,I have a 15 pro and I thought the action button was the camera control button… lol. I’ve never changed it from the ringer toggle since I like to have it there
@thamaraipoo-rj3eo,still using xs max for daily use which is fulfilling all the needs... AI is a baby now needs more development.... Iphone 18 pro will be a best upgrade for me...
@Mrjasurhere,Here is what I found on the web😅 this statement killed me😮😂
@fimmyf,The only channel that reviews apple product unbiased. Apple should just stop making phones and start making cameras since thats the only thing they call innovation over there.
@eddbrennan,touch sensitive side button… nobody’s talking about what phone cover you’re going to buy

@MrOrtmeier,Imo the improvements to the new iPhones are fantastic! 2 new buttons are very welcome in my book. And that teal is the best colour by far. <br><br>I&#39;m broke but somehow want to get hold of this

@KingJKickz,"Firget adding a camera button 😒,something android did 15 yrs ago.<br>How about putting an SD Card Slot . 😅"
@m.g.2460,I just ordered the 15 plus. I just don’t notice the pro motion stuff and all I wanted from the 16 was faster charging speeds. AI isn’t really there jet anyway and when it will be useful someday I will just buy a new one.
@supersadra8689,60 hz in 2024 is just pathetic... Like even most budget phones now have a minimum 90hz 💀💀 (mine has 144hz)
@VRStoned1978,Ifixit rating is the most important… did you know that if anything breaks on your ipad 12.9 its a 1200$ replacement option only.. button break 1200$… small screen crack..1200$ .. usb c connector break.. 1200$. How did we allow Apple to do this?
@hakujo,"So really not much innovation at all, recycled stuff."
@HomiebeaR_,This is probably the most boring phone release of 2024 and u can see that in arun&#39;s eyes and body language in this video 😅.
@callmetito,This Apple event was not good. My only thought was how Apple would screw us this year. I will buy a new iPhone when I can own the unit 100%
@iconicheroes,2 key differences in 15 vs 16 are....Capture button pretty useless (we don&#39;t spend that much of our time taking landscape photos and videos) and apple intelligence (coming this fall and that too with very limited features...wtf ) so these 2 dont really matter so if you&#39;re planning to buy an iPhone go with 15 unless you have immense money falling out from your pocket..
@tmmehedi,When apple forgets about innovation 😢
@awwskit9753,Apple is full of BS Google is killing them in innovation right now
@TheLexikitty,Today I learned people don’t manually focus shots.

@mxhxsh,Just upload the same last year&#39;s video. Same shit new name.
@esantosh5208,Finally some hardwear changes and bang..😂😂
@imaginesagi,I really like the new camera button but overall this keynote was disappointing. It feels like they just corrected mistakes from the iPhone 15 launch which was a carbon copy of the iPhone 14. They added the new feature and put other last year features from the pro model to the regular model…which they have done for years. <br><br>I was hoping for a round Apple Watch when they announced a whole new design but that was the same ol smaller bezels “redesign”.
@A_fat_gerbil,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=326"">5:26</a> omg that’s what I said as well when I saw the announcement!"

@IDontModWTFz,"5 in the morning, really?"
@ST43LERS,We&#39;re the problem. We need to stop upgrading.  If we want these companies to stop giving us spec bump phones.
@theproblem9938,My conclusion: if you do not care about being a filmmaker you don’t need the  16 pro😂
@AndreaMiano,Camera button is basically an useless gimmick... <br>Still 60hz on the base model<br>Apple &quot;intelligence&quot; is basically a fraction of what the s24 already does...<br>Only good thing is the new chip being in all them 4
@ralphw7454,"I never really cared about phone specs. I’m still using an iPhone 7+. But I recently switched careers and started a side business in cheese and wine. Now, I’m creating more content, especially if I’m in the vineyard or with the cows, and my 7+ just can’t keep up. With the 16 Pro or Pro Max, I’m thinking it’s time to upgrade.<br><br>It’s funny how people complain the iPhone looks the same every year. Do they really need something flashy and new-looking every time? As attention spans get shorter, everyone wants the shiny new toy, but Apple’s design is already near perfect, they’re just fine-tuning the edges each year. Why change something that isn’t broken? Sure, Android has cool new phones, but Apple keeps it simple but continues to tweak adjustments. The way it looks doesn’t need to be changed, it’s fine. Also with the new Siri upgrades, it’s like having my own personal assistant. I’m excited about that too!!"
@Shhtick,yeah im still on the 11 pro and I won&#39;t be upgrading anytime soon. still feels like my 11 can do anything a 16 can do.
@krushnatonge457,They give upgraded gpu with ray tracing for gaming but screen still 60 Hz on iphone 16.<br>What the use of gpu?

@KazrBrekker,Did Apple really think people who would be buying the &#39;cheaper&#39; iPhones will be the same people purchasing their 3600 dollar Vision Pro. Wow!!! Tim Cook is a genius. I as a matter of fact liked the old design with the oblique camera placement

@irishn8,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=890"">14:50</a> seems like the pro phones should focus on pro features for... get this.. professionals 😮😮😮"
@MrOvchiyan,"Gee, just buy Samsung and solve all of your problems 😊"
@user-mi8kb4ir4x,HOLD ON WHEN DID IT RELEASEE???
@user-kh1ro6wv3t,Damn no much of a change. Pretty boring I would say. Nobody is going to upgrade.
@ltitus8900,"Apple just charged their customers the same premium prices seen from flagship Android manufacturers but without actually giving you real updates. For crying out loud, they are charging you premium price for last gen tech. Their 2000 nits and 4k 120hz display is more that a generation behind, their  chassis has literally minimal updates, the software changes are anorexic and it&#39;s features are literally the standard with android based AI models. But it is current gen pricing."
@MariaRostamo,Think my Iphone 7 plus is gonna be upgraded finally :P
@SanderEvers,If the new camera button means we&#39;ll see more vertical photo&#39;s and video&#39;s then I&#39;m 100% for adding it. I don&#39;t really like portrait photo&#39;s.
@geiers6013,You really are weird sometimes. Really a good gaming experience with 60hz? I would immediately call out that the whole experience is just bad compared to any other decent phone because of 60hz alone...
@CinemaSingh4199,Imagine paying 799$ and you still get 60hz Display in 2024/5
@yoteca,This year&#39;s presentation was an absolute dud. They really said &quot;look at this revolutionary design&quot; with a straight face and proceeded to show the same phone yet again. It makes absolutely 0 sense to change phones sooner than 3 years apart.
@RapidRation,The next iPhone 17 will have same cameras as the 7 plus 😅
@AS-gb5wz,Still 60hz 😂
@techwithshikhar,The rated battery life is mentioned in the tech specs page (for all iPhones)
@sarashere1066,Nowadays car launches are more exciting than mobile launches as they get significant tech and upgrades...
@macdonaldmachacha7940,A yawn
@Aeve4714,CMF phone 😂
@HS-yz7ui,"60hz screen, what a joke. Even a phone with 100usd price now has at least 90hz."
@KyngShadow,I&#39;m still on the 11 pro so yeah apple tryna get me to upgrade with this lol....i kinda wish the action button and the camera button spots were swapped. All i&#39;d want the action button for is to take easy screenshots....thats it. I will probably never use the camera button. I&#39;m also concerned about accidentally hitting it?
@aliki1713,iPhone 16: hey can i copy ur homework <br>iPhone X: sure just don&#39;t make it too obvious <br>iPhone 16:
@nilanjanghosh8984,Apple lost innovation
@sanjeevkumarmaddukuri76,Can we expect the world&#39;s smallest iphone from you? 😅
@Andre_vyent,60hz ?!?!? ON 16??? RIP OFF!
@Foxhunter-h6z,"APPLE IS JUST BORING, ANDROID WORLD IS COMPETITIVE AND 💡 INNOVATIVE.."
@yuritaproductions,Arun where did your Apple Watch go didn’t it change your life
@todorbodurov6793,Still 60 hz ?!
@CrazeyP,I think the camera button is them trying to test if they can put sensors in the power button later down the line and bring back finger print unlock
@MISmotionimagesound,🥱
@dailyhubranx,It all means nothing. Gaming ? PS5/PC ? Productivity? Laptop. <br>Movies ? Tv.<br>mobile gaming ? Steam deck.<br>AI? i got a brain..and chat gpt..aaand Leonardo ai.
@izz_tokisaki2603,what a super innovation is this product 😱
@demetri78,What a huge letdown. Apple is going boring us lately. They lack talent. Hopefully Elon Musk creates a phone with some energy.
@DanulSenadeera,The WAR Started Samsung S24 Ultra 💖 vs iphone 16 pro max 🔥💯
@burnsyblues,The only feature i really want is the studio quality microphones - as someone who uses my iphone to record guitar playing its a much needed upgrade. Considering we are in the age of content creating im shocked this is not more of a talking point. The recording quality on phones sucks.
@FifyKaqiqiPain,Samsung Galaxy S24: Hold my beer
@frnz9808,This event could&#39;ve been an email.
@MohammadYasin-c3e,How about pi phone from Elon musk
@malindurajapaksha1791,That side button is a haptic button so apple should make a software upgrade to make it a fingerprint
@Sameer-vb1sw,The last 2 iPhones &quot;BREAKING NEW&quot; features were adding new buttons....what a joke

@samuraicris,"Will the Apple Intelligence come to iPhone 15 pro too, or just on the 16s?"
@wilddog6060,"Interesting to note that the view is that AI features are &quot;early&quot; - that is how it works - it is a learning architecture - it consumes the data provided (which you have no idea of - it&#39;s not just clicks or responses.  It is timings, in a day, week, month, it is speed of response  - and that data has been signed off to Apple somewhere in middle of a tome of a license agreement .  I still do it but, be assured, the value of this data we give away is of great value"

@Theonly_one2,"Not too sound like iPhone hater, why does it seem like iPhone focuses on cameras when creating a new phone, it is becoming less for the normal user but for photographers."

@jeremytucker2588,Just paid 300 for an iPhone 14 Plus with a trade in I had so I’m good for a while. Don’t care about Dynamic Island. Will upgrade whenever they put 120hz on regular version iPhones.
@enikinyshitpostcentral,apple stole samsung&#39;s camera design for the iphone 16
@bumblahouse6715,A better camera a newer chip a new design a new ai system with a lot of benefits siri updates new camera button the action button for those who like it and for cheap <br><br>You basically get a 15 pro but 20% less advantage and 40% cheaper <br><br>This is a cop for me .if u dont like it dont buy it and dont complain about it
@Hamzashahab096,WTF? They turned off the comments on the official release video 😂😂😂😂.
@known3617,"My favorite part of the event was tim apple walking on stage saying how apple watch series 10 has a larger display than apple watch ultra 2, proceeds to show the display is literally a single fucking pixle larger in diameter... Holy shit this company is ridiculous. <br><br>Between gatekeeping software as a &quot;feature&quot; and giving a camera button 10 years to late. Apple one of the most successful and disconnected companies on the planet."
@JHsadler,"This leaves me in a predicament... I have a 12 Pro Max which just died today (screen failure), good timing?<br><br>I feel a lot more compelled to buy the S24 Ultra over the 16 Pro. It just looks like a better design in almost every way, and I feel bored of iPhones now. Two things though:<br><br>One: Surely I should wait for the 25 Ultra at this rate<br>Two: Being quite heavily invested in the Apple Ecosystem, mac, iPad, AirPods, Apple Watch and so on... Is it worth binning most of that off to leave Apple?"

@xdyt2007,Now compare the iphone 16pro max to your giant iphone.
@akshayk95,"apple&#39;s comparison is like, <br>You get 60% marks in exam, but you say last year I got only 40%, so compatitively This is my achievement😂"
@-N0V4-,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=500"">8:20</a> they seem to have modelled this after Samsung phones which are designed for people who do work and casual stuff on their phone. They ignore that Apple users tend to have multiple devices for work and casual communication vs the average Samsung user that has their entire life on the one device"
@nawwk79,"Until Apple totally removes the Dynamic Island and give us a true bezel less screen, i will not buy any iPhones."
@billyallen7690,"That new button is the dumbest addition to a phone for 2024. Who tf has been walking around with their iphone saying, &quot;if only i had a shutter button for my camera app. That right there would be revolutionary&quot;? They should have focused more on their damn heating issues. Damn iphone 15 Pro Max is like a dang iOven."
@Joanyan,there&#39;s so many generations of underscreen tech out but instead of getting rid pf the ugly forehead they decided they needed AI in the phone lmfao apple is all downhill
@Techlikeme,"I&#39;m normally excited for the new iPhone but basically this year they&#39;ve added a camera button that Sony have had for years, they&#39;ve added 4k 120 video that Sony have had for years, also samsung have had it a bit now. Also the usual yearly upgrades. Boring this time round."

@Mallusailorinaustralia,Why don’t you guys make a video on the complaints that iPhones are having after the software updates…. The quality of products are very low these days from Apple.. Guess they are paying you guys off to not to make those kind of videos
@Vikanuck,Can iPhone just chill the hell out and give me like… a year—maybe two—to get accustomed to the iPhone I already have before jamming their newest model into my face??<br><br>If anyone could pass this on to the biggest boss at Apple that’d be greeeaaatttt

@HShango,"So many of the features apple bragged about in that event, again reminded me of the android camp which already had a lot of the features but under a different name like e.g. Hear Test on apple in  android is basically HearID.<br><br><br>Also the latest iphones were boring to see to, nothing their convinced me to consider iPhone 16 (line up). But I&#39;m confident my siblings are all bending a knee for apple right now"

@arshu_parshu1999,Apple has more subs then you now
@TimbaEmmanuel,Me still using an iPhone 7 Plus 😢😢😂
@Taylor___,The camera action button is too low down for me. It’ll be annoying to use vertically. What Apple need to do is have the ability of shooting in portrait and landscape mode at the same time.
@samgurung8047,Should i upgrade from 13 pro max?
@OffZoroYt,Man it‘s a shame that EU doesn’t have Apple Intelligence 😢
@i.am.mezbah,Apple is realising that they are not the innovators. <br>So they should go back in time. <br><br>Technology’s motive is to make life easier get rid of unnecessary things. But Apple is trying to make things harder.

@justsomerandompeople4353,this whole 2024 smartphone flagship is sucks all only care about ai that can only be used by software update and yet here they are marketing about their great ai stuff and most of them cannot deliver the ai features early but later. just reminder that were are getting scams this year just look laptops and pc do they need special processor for ai? no right? even old flagship with software update can have all those ai features lol htey just limit their software for us to buy the newer model

@pinipuchi,"So basically in the EU the only difference is the Button and the 48mpx ultra-wide... I have the Iphone 15 pro max and I just wanted a 6,7 with thinner bezels, lighter, brighter display more efficient and with a better battery overall. Just simple adjustments that didn&#39;t happen at all. Now it&#39;s 6,9, heavier and bulkier."
@rantsofedub,The photo is so poorly positioned barely anyone takes iphone images on landscape. And it’s placed on the right so right handed people using it in portrait is gonna be super awkward.

@oqeufh,If you have anything from the 13 up then it will be a bit of a useless upgrade but for anyone with a beat up 7 year old iPhone 8 like myself I&#39;m excited to finally try out all the new stuff that came out last year in a slightly improved casing lol.

@The_Predatorkiller,"The base iPhone 16s would be tolerable if they could have at least added a 120hz display. Forget 120hz, a 90hz display would do the job, too. What is Apple cooking? Paying premium prices for a 60hz phone is borderline criminal in 2024-2025."
@brentomagic,So in a nutshell... Nothing new.
@thamzhiyong3161,Watching this from an a54 just realised that iphone user can delay upgrading again...
@tokishimaharuto2586,Where is 90 hz ??on normal 16😂
@viveksivadas5961,The vertical layout is to make sure that people recognize the cheaper iphones easily so that the Pro remains more valuable in comparison to Plus..

@VojtechMach,"People used to camp on streets overnight to buy new iphones, now we just make jokes online."
@shankarnarayanan9792,I think apple can officially now declare that the future iPhone models will only be coming once in 2 years or 3 years because this event was literally so repetitive and had very little new stuff to look forward to
@ashtraygaming355,Wow😮😮 just looks like all the previous iPhones 🤯🤯 😂😂😂
@MizarcDev,A huge benefit of switching to iPhone for me is that the changes are always so small that I have less incentive to upgrade. Can&#39;t have FOMO to upgrade from my 15 Pro if the 16 Pro barely changed anything.
@davidn.2555,iPhones are so useless bruh 😅
@hafezmozafari,"Apple is putting more focus on professionals with the pro devices. With the iPhone, they are making it more of a professional tool for Videographers and photographers. It makes sense that they are adding a shutter button (thats what they should have called it!) and manual focusing. The shutter buttun is only for landscape mode use, when your in portrait, it&#39;s easier to use the controls on the screen."
@Holowel71,"Watched the keynote and I was very underwhelmed with everything actually. Hoped maybe I missed some killer feature but after watching your video I’m still convinced I don’t need to upgrade from my iPhone 13 mini😅. Great video, thanks."

@MrFreezeEdits,Apple is apple... People will still buy it and uhh that&#39;s because apple basically trained people to buy their shit
@FifyKaqiqiPain,The iPhone 16 is really just an iPhone 15 with slightly more features

@jaiboi23,Sounds like everyone is getting pretty bored with Apple&#39;s &#39;revolutionary&#39; updates year in year out...Come on Apple about time you made these events exciting as they were a few years ago! Where are new designs? gah hahaha but Im probably still going to get the the iphone 16 pro max at some stage...
@darthvader1770,"Lol this apple event is by far one of the boring events I&#39;ve ever watched, All they added is one capture button with few here n there. I bet people aren&#39;t going to use this new capture button as the ancient action button. Apple has nothing revolutionary to offer..."

@yanjiekoo6894,Arun will you also be making a video on Huawei Mate XT? I mean they did decide the crash Apple&#39;s launch and if im not mistaken thats the first every triple fold device they ever launched
@JorgeLazo-r5y,I would be so interested to compare how you and your partner use your iPhones. I think many of your fans would appreciate how you banter with iOS and personal preferences! My two cents.
@iCazZiStronZi,It’s basically just an iPhone 15 with an extra button and they moved one camera over a few centimetres on the base models. I don’t understand why Apple is doing like very minimal upgrades to their new phones. I have a 15 pro and the 16 isn’t even different enough for me to want to get it. I will probably have to wait until like iPhone 19 or 20 before its even worth upgrading 😂
@MasterCamus,So Pro phones shouldn’t be catered to pro now?
@McSmurfy,"I can&#39;t see the appeal to these phones. It looks like the same boring design with some &#39;innovative&#39; changes, I would rather have that world biggest phone and the guy who surpassed Apple is much cooler😏😅."

@trojanhell7639,"How do you advertise a A18 chip but pair it with 8GB RAM? 😂 doesn’t even make sense …. The A18 is ONLY super fast if you have NEOUGH RAM to keep …. 8GB RAM wont let A18 chip show its true speed … <br><br>When you have multiple apps open or are doing a lot of things at once, 8GB of RAM will not be enough to keep all those apps ready to go. The A18 chip can process those tasks quickly, but with limited RAM, the phone has to pause some apps or refresh them to free up space. This slows things down even though the chip itself could handle more, if only the RAM were bigger."

@ReddO_Live,Apple changes camera designs so people would know the difference in generations and be judged if you got the older version and feel like an outcast even within the community and push you to get the newest one
@emanuelV8,1 Year of work snd than this?😂
@j797s25,"I used to be excited about new iPhones. I had assumed each phone would be faster, battery last longer and less and less bugs/problems.

Atleast after 2 year, they used to change design! Here from Iphone 13 to this iphone( except for that dynamic island upgrade on 14, but then no design change at all for 3 gens), nothing in particular has changed, specially in terms of design!! Guess, I will be keeping my Iphone 14 pro for another 2-3 years!"
@exceladeogun3591,I see Cowboy Carter ❤
@Jootunn,"A friend of mine put it pretty well. iPhones are catering towards the creative videographer crowd. Samsung, especially with the Ultra, is preferred by executives/suits. Pixel lives somewhere in between but also has the best casual still photography, but can also be modified with custom ROMs to retool for specific needs. With RCS coming on iOS 18, unless you specifically need the above feature sets, you can pick basically whichever phone you want and you&#39;ll do fine for the next 5+ years."

@met8689,Still on my 13 pro max and still not convinced on upgrading.
@Richang168,"Hmmm. Well I like the phone, but is apple going to add a new button every year?"
@rick_terscale1111,iCamera 16 Pro / Max ... featuring internet and phone capabilities.
@greys_wrld,its weird how apple gives you more camera features and you complain... but when other phone companies do it you say apple is behind

@mysticlion2057,"The 16 and 16 plus looks trash compared to the 15 and 15 plus lineup. Cheap colors, no visible upgrade and the camera alignment is just not good looking."
@donaldcallahan7412,The only thing that matters at this point is the IOS 18 software. .  SIRI has been around for since the iphone 4S and has only become moderately useful in the last couple of years.  The AI is probably going to be the same.  Apple has a pattern of showing all these awesome demos to only find out it only works 2% of the time.

@Zed7762,Apple just changed the camera a bit and called it a day
@James.576,No 120Hz refresh on the 16?

@middleclassyt1295,At this point iphone 16 pro max compare to 15 pro is just a scam. It&#39;s the same phone just wrapped in new colour and bew name.
@TheSacagiu,So glad I bought the 15 pro max last month. The camera button is just a gimmick similar to MacBook’s touchbar.

@ToreOnYouTube,"Honestly, this iPhone announcement is probably the least exiting since I can remember."
@4l3kis,"Oh no, the PRO phones are targeted at the PROFESSIONALS…"
@Theleochan,"Forba phone at this price point, the base model lacks basic specs like 120hz or USB 3. The pro variant is just recycling from the past years. Nothing new, as always. They&#39;re pieces of trash that should end up in the bin as soon as between the hands of consumers. Remember what Steve Wozniak said about apple and its current state."
@Mr.Beasley,Apple users will turn all these old features (from other phones) into ground breaking features lol

@sarad7067,How is this posted so fast
@picxal1948,Apple is at the point where they&#39;re adding in new features that normal people won&#39;t use. Barely any difference between iOS and Android at this point.
@user-gt6wt5hx7p,We got iPhone 16 before gta 6 😢
@sandihermana4873,I hope you&#39;re not switching back to the iphone after release the iphone 16 and always stay on S24 ultra😂

@Cayota_Foxpaw,Another downside with apple intelligence. It won’t be available in the EU for a while
@SteveLKarr,"So, still no iFlip yet? Or, uh - iPhone Flip? iPhlip? Whatever. I would like to see a foldable iPhone in the near future. Before I die, like in my lifetime would be nice, please. They’re so supposedly technologically advanced, then why have so many Android makers delivered on this, but not Apple? Sure, I’m content with my iPhone 15 Pro, so no need to get the 16. But if it were a big folding one or flip open? Maybe I would try one of those. A flip or a fold. At least THAT would be a MAJOR change, ya know? This…is not. Steve Jobs is probably rolling over in his grave, his ghost screaming inaudibly, “Innovative, damn you! What the hell is the matter with you people?! When is the last time you people INNOVATED? Don’t make me come up there!” 😁"

@sineadbutler8495,Iv a regular iPhone 14 so gonna go for the iPhone 16 pro 😊
@guitarmyheartsbeat,Add new button for opening camera app there you go its a new genration of iphone 😂😂😂😂.
@muntasirrahman04,no fingerprint sensor? 😭
@gokurama2884,Why not use that camera feature button for finger print wtf apple
@Cenixv8,Watch the fuckin video before you talk shit.
@reuv_jr,Calling it Apple Intelligence just sounds funny to me LOL
@opukar2043,I found so far all new features in iPhone 16 got from pixel

@nazmussakib7851,Apple 16 be like 16 years ago technology ⚙ reinnovate again with new brand new cover new color 🤡. Just waste of Money to buy 16 series.

@yuvaraajravindaran8060,Im using Ip11.. well im planning to upgrade ip16 pro max.. do you guys think is it okay?
@mrgenesis6289,Having a new button for 16 Pro amazing innovation 😂😂
@Abbidy,Those could be a reason for iPhone users to use their phones horizontal when in camera app
@abi5h,me still waiting for something new..
@JuniorAstrophotographer,Congrats on your world record 🎉🎉🎉
@rudelsp69,Lol. New phone for the sheeple
@fxn09here,The camera button feels so unnecessary
@jonnycarlson9555,I&#39;m afraid @Mrwhosetheboss will not get an invite to next Apple event. This was actually pretty unbiased🤔
@guitarmyheartsbeat,I think instead of skipping chip generation they should have skipped two generations of iphone so that they will be able to present more features in 17 series.
@meowwow8340,Looks like ill be sticking with my 14 pro max for the next 2 years more 😂😅😊

@habbitmonster4430,Idk why would anyone buy iphones in 2024 unless someone is dump or to showoff i see zero reason to buy this trash of a phone
@TheAppleGuy.,I’m so tempted to get a pro even though I’m on a 14. It’s not worth it but the Apple intelligence is so cool.
@brentjuras1492,Sounds like a whole lot of features nobody cares about

@ChristianHernandez-cs2mu,"This feels like a place holder.  Something to put out now.  Not necessarily a cash grab but definitely not a phone they are completely proud of.  With that said, I do believe they are working on something but for now have released this."
@Cristian-to4bq,I sense apple just selling people for cameras features than anything else. same look every year and nothing changes. I’d rather just switch to Samsung fold
@guitarmyheartsbeat,"Basically whole upgrade is just a freaking button, like for me its useless who is going to make movies ha. Why did they launched phone now when all upgrade ms are coming till 2025."
@karshoaebshorts,It is the same phone as previous one with just some software upgrades
@adyady3099,x100 ultra is another level compared to samsung and iphone
@skyMcWeeds,60hz on a premium device such a revolution
@lufu10,why is the screen still 60hz? cmon dude
@robertbryanlitao347,When will Promotion go down to the base model? Is the screen more expensive than the chipset?

@Senti1122,60 hz💀💀💀
@Sweetwaterdream,I am one of those slow adopters...Its time to update my chipped/scratched/barely alive iphone 12 😅

@BITWEEZY1,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=201"">3:21</a> Samsung did it with Bixby long ago"
@extremeDimension,"As a user of both android and iphones, what i think is , android focus on pushing more and more features and at the point it’s becoming more useless features for marketing rather than practical. Iphone dont go with that approach. They dont want to be on top of the spec sheet. They focus on the little things which specs cant convey.The quality of features delivered is much more than android phones. And it’s these little things which gives you that better feel factor."
@BruthaManTee,Why would they put another button on the side of the phone what if you accidentally hit
@AayushKarwatkar,Shoutout to @mkbhd cameo
@4kryptik4,What games were those?
@BruceLlE,Every year Apple releases a feature that is simply just a gimmick to get people to buy new phones.  Remember when panoramic photos first came out?  Nobody uses panoramic pictures.  😂😂😂
@backpackingtony1779,Looks like I’ll be upgrading when the iPhone 17 comes out. There’s not enough upgrades to change my 13 Pro Max.
@blossomebogbue2245,Feels like apple is getting really desperate for features 😂
@pawewicher2112,Would&#39;ve been cool if the camera button was a fingerprint scanner too
@derekeveritt1928,"I’ve had the iPhone 14 Pro for a couple years now and am thinking of getting the 16 Pro. I like watching your videos and trust your opinion.<br>Would you say it’s worth the upgrade now or wait another year or two? I like taking photos and videos of my cats, family/friend gatherings, hikes, and landscapes. Nothing too creative though. <br> My last phone was a 7 Plus so waiting on significant upgrades is something I can do.<br><br>Appreciate your input."
@AayushKarwatkar,So iPhone 16 is the new iPhone SE
@duser,"That capacitive button looks like a test more than it looks like a new feature. If people like how this functions, i have a feeling they will replace the power button or even the volume rocker with this new button."
@shree397,OK THIS IS A FACT:<br>The camera dedicated button is technically older than the iPhone themselves😂<br>Don&#39;t call it an innovation 😂
@roro-v3z,Hey! Please also test Huawei triple folding phones
@blualg,"No matter how much Apple (or the reviewers) says Apple Intelligence, it will still be Artificial Intelligence. It&#39;s something when they introduce a new name for an existing idea, it’s another stupid thing to try to rename something industry (or academic) standard."
@stefenleung,That&#39;s a real shame.  90hz or 120hz refresh rate is a basic stuff most of the low-budget phones have that.
@lokeshm8860,“The seven people who own them” 🥲🥲🥲😅

@AhmedHassan-ld3wj,My mere question is  Iphone 16 is worth to purchase it or not please I need an urgent help.
@myrtlekenazjanairo9411,60Hz screen in 2024. Wow. Just wow.<br>Even Dirt cheap phones have at least 90Hz screen now.
@AVenjoyer-787,iPhone - from 2007 there were added 2 buttons!<br>Apple Mouses - No shit
@superdutyzack,"1.) I’m completely over A.I marketing, it’s not A.I. <br>2.) Bigger battery but still under 30 watts of charging is dumb. <br>3.) Cameras are literally the same damn thing.<br>4.) literally zero no fun camera modes.<br><br>Overall my takeaway is this is a iPhone 15.5, i wouldn’t even call it a 15 S."
@techimposter5582,Same processors with new naming....seems kinda resembles their competitors.....😂😂😂😂...poor apple can&#39;t even admit it....they want their users to upgrades their smartphones every year...but same as last version....is it really necessary to upgrade absolutely not...im good with my iphone 13

@BunnyBean,16 release doesn&#39;t bring much ... Meh
@parthsb,60Hz base model is robbery
@qwertykeys5509,those who have 15  they dont need to upgrade but people like me with 11 pro from last 5 year i will upgrade to 16 pro  and people need to understand these upgrades are not for the people who change phones every year these are for the majority of people like me who uses their phone for long time those who change every year they will not see any difference even s24 and s23 has minor differences but the difference is huge for someone who was using s20 s10 etc other than tech influencers  and rich people or tech geeks majority of world population uses their phones for atleast 3+ year and majority makes the market not exceptions cause exceptions are not examples only majority can be quoted as example
@prospernwosu6057,Here&#39;s where I asked you to PLEASE GIFT ME ANY IPHONE OF YOUR CHOICE FOR NO REASON
@gdnt,"About needing to manual focus: what iPhone are you experiencing? 😅<br>Have you tried to use the 14 or 15 Pro in concerts? It refuses to focus.

@stephenkim5725,Hard pass for me - 15 pro max user

@17Sterling,How did Samsung &amp; Google beat Apple to AI Features???!!!
@kingcroakdesigns68,"Honestly, I wish I could opt out of all AI and AI generated content."
@aidilharis95,still 60hz? 😂😂😂
@KaleemIqbalravian,You guys usually get to meet the leading people of the industry. Please do put up the question that why is Apple not making changes to the design? iPhone pro max lineup all looks same no matter what version you have there is no way to tell what model are you holding from a distance.
@jasonzhou6437,"I live in China so here’s some insider scoop from iPhone manufacturing: Apple paying more for 60Hz display production lines than its 120Hz. Since the industry mostly moved to 120Hz or 90Hz, economics of scale makes it expensive to produce 60Hz display now"
@tafarapaul,"Apple was like, wait, we go the camera layout right the first time when we made iPhone X😂😂"
@sjorsp99,16 still with an 10 year old LCD screen?

@rachitbansal54,Is it fare to assume that we are saying good bye to charging cable and port next year since mag safe has been upgraded to fast charging and not the regular cabled charging?
@SteevWho,"This is nowhere near what Google has done. Where Android 15 will not be adding a bunch of new features with 15, Apple&#39;s implementation here is most of the selling points of this new device. The things that will be launching with IOS 18 initially will not be as impactful. The new Siri, other than the animation will not be the smarter version they spoke about. You will not be getting the generative emojis and whatnot, those functionalities will be released Next Year. It should be also mentioned that a bunch of these AI features only work with native apps. Like the email thing, only with Apple Mail. If you don&#39;t use Apple Mail, it has no functionality. Page reading and editing on the web, a Safari Only feature. The AI features at this point are half baked, at best at this point, and they used it to sell these new devices. I am wondering when Apple is going to step their game up, but we say that every year. Maybe next year... Until people stop blindly buying iPhones they are going to keep dragging their feet. What is making the shareholders happy is not so exciting for the consumers. When you are a big corporation like Apple is, I guess it&#39;s less about the consumers though, and more about those profits for the big wigs. Maybe they should use these Chinese companies not just build their phones, and actually design them. China is leaps and bounds ahead of Apple in design and bringing new features to the market than Apple has been for years now. Apple is going to start culling their own herd with more and more people passing on the newer devices, or just leaving the platform all together for more aesthetically and feature rich devices. Good Luck Apple,"

@JennNofficial,I wasn&#39;t gonna upgrade to the 16pplus in pink thinking it would be the same pink shade as the 15 plus so id go to 15plus pink but seeing the darker pink now is making me change my mind lol. I really don&#39;t get my phones for super extra tech features. it&#39;s more for color and maybe some features my current 14plus doesn&#39;t have lol. until I see the two pink phones in person ill decide then which one my heart wants more. ive wanted a pink phone since the deep pink magenta Razr flip phone.  this will be my Christmas present ive had my 14plus since 2021 actually. 💖💖💖💖💕💕💕📱

@eckardvermeulen2888,Will the 15 Pro Max get Apple Intelegence in a iOS update?
@hemiacetal1331,They&#39;ve already peaked. The only way forward is to either reintroduce some old design or technology or AI catgirls.
@acmazn,wait was the iphone 15 the previous gen i thought 14 was new

@anshumanshridhar,Can&#39;t they just add side fingerprint scanner instead  of adding usless features
@pdizbon,I cannot stand pastel colors!! I will never buy Apple but that is also for many other reasons.
@dercrokk,The best iphone EVER! (until the next model that will add maybe a few things). ot the mention the outrageous differences in prices among the US and Europe.. it&#39;s a super easy PASS
@Professional_ice,Mf at least give 90hz in base model 🤦🏻‍♂️

@nickithefish2484,Apple is marketing the wrong thing.. we don’t care about AI like yes we do but we don’t care enough for it to be the marketing point as it appeals to no one
@pushpankarjaiswal8204,This is real review of phone when  no one&#39;s holding a briefcase full of money behind the camera.😅
@Elijah-fc3ex,Shit is the exact same lmao
@Iconicmulcheater,I think its outrageous that i will probably have to wait more than a year for apple intelligence

@thecreation-13,Have Apple stopped entertaining you ?
@lilricchie5013,Looks like phones are now at the peak of &#39;normal user&#39; features and what Apple is doing now is just adding a bunch of stuff not everyone will use

@icebearOP,Now it looks like OnePlus phone 😂
@emp1985,"So lets recap: Apple Watch 10 is basically a Series 9 with a 1mm slim-down and water temperature sensor, AirPods 4 are basically AirPods Pro 2nd Gen in non-Pro shell, iphone 16 is the 15 with a new camera lens layout and two more buttons, and the Pros barely got some new camera features. Oh, and Apple believes at the end of 2024 that above 60Hz and AOD screens are Pro features.<br>In any company, this pathetic year-over-year product development would have heads roll... Apple has done it for 3-4 years in a row now. Do they even work there? I&#39;d be seriously interested in hearing from an Apple employee on what expectations they set every year.<br>Seems my iphone 13 will see yet another year of use then..."
@danielschmaderer,"I own the iPhone 12 Pro and absolutely love it. Though I am going to upgrade to the 16 pro because 1) the battery is absolutely terrible, and 2) the lightning port stopped working a few months back."
@prajitthommundru1078,having a touch sensitive camera button makes no sense for users with cases since cases are nowadays pretty thick and reaching the button with a case on is literally impossible
@boop5110,Seriously thats it? Iphone 16? i was going to upgrade from S21 to Iphone16 😅 maybe this is a bad idea
@SouryaDP,"I think they saw the two-stage shutter key of Sony phones, and thought they could put some more features on it, showing it as a revolution…."
@Capital_minute,Still 60HZ on the 16???<br>Come on Apple🤦‍♂️
@HT-773,I will not Upgrade but i like it
@zakiraliyev-fs3cm,"I want to switch to iPhone for better sync with my Mac. But inly 3 things stop me from doing so : 1) No finger scanner. I like finger scanner.  Faster than face recognition. 2) No google lens for screen search. Yeah, I know that you can do a similar one with a shortcuts app, but it is not as efficient as samsung one. <br>3) Quick access to google gemini (swipe from right bottom corner to up).<br><br>I guess, i have to stick with fold 4 for several years unless these futures appear on iOS. Otherwise, i have to buy a samsung s+ series."
@NandaKumarnk10,apple is always 2 step ahead by staying 2 steps behind
@RollerCoasterPsycho,This is the most accurate review !!
@djarthurlooby,Apple IA is now as smart as Google Assistant 5 years ago. And an new but not new apple specific 799 feature is 60hrz refresh rate amazing. And the camera button. Hello lumina phones. Really amazing new stuff in the iPhones every year they just blow our minds. Also playing console games lvl games on a phone is also not new. Phones do that for years. One word. GAMEPASS.
@Fadesign100,"4 studio mic&#39;s to hear you better, you mean spy on you ?"
@TitanKnockout,If the new camera button second as a thumb print reader that would have been a sale

@WiFuzzy,All these tech channels are starting to have the same problem. The new gizmo is not really any better that the old one. Social media does not care what phone you have. The images posted on social media all look the same no matter what which phone was used. The reviewers are all trying to find something to justify the new thing. I just tend to stop watching them now...whats the point. The new color that is hidden by the case? I could use the phone I had 6 yeasrs ago and probably not really notice. Maybe it&#39;s just me.
@senpaiofficial69,Watching this video knowing that you won’t be able to purchase any apple devices 😅<br>Just here to support Arun🫶🏻
@user-cr6ki4qs4y,2025 - New color: Poo Titanium 💩
@arpitagasty6535,"My honest answer, Almost all the companies have AI features enabled on their phone in various different ways butt the way apple implements all the stuff with some smooth animations and textures, I would say in terms of look and implementation apple’s just majestic. The animations in all other stuff except AI and including AI left me thunderstruck in the event."
@mromagachi5194,so the same phone since 2018 cool
@Crimsonisbetter,How are cases gonna work with the camera button?
@tilak231,"An admire of Apple echo system and seamless synching capabilities, I like the Siri update but lack of significant updates to iPhones makes me dislike the Apple as a whole! Smart watch costing 799-399 is too costly! 6-7 years old Airpods still selling at almost the same price is insane!! People still love them and Apple taking advantage of it!"
@robertromero4611,I feel like the 13pro max is still a better value as old as it is. 😅
@chm985,They moved the camera to look like Samsung because they look better

@zlee2656,Alright i agree that apple bevent ecoming more and more of a joke . beating around the bush as it is apple mov3. apple intteligence sound more like mossad than fbi. and colors are becoming woke feature if u follow thw apple event closely.

@ligenyodu2645,funny it looks like an android now
@mkh656,Looking forward to the battery tests. Always feel slightly disappointed with their battery improvements year on year. ‘Best battery on an iPhone’ just means squeezing out a few extra minutes on the new version compared to last years.

As a iPhone 13 user, my reaction is &quot;Nice new features, but so what?&quot;<br><br>Big selling point used to be that you would be able to always carry a point-and-shoot camera in your pocket that was integrated into your phone. But now you can make a bunch of manual adjustments with a shiny new button? Yes, this is something that 2% of users will find amazing."
@ObumnemeNnadi,Maybe they should be releasing new phones every two years because the upgrades aren&#39;t that great
@masterdinosawr,Apple doesn&#39;t give a fuck about its customers.
@jawenjaw,I hope Apple can make or customize the Camera button to other functionalities like for scrolling to social media apps or adjust volume when sliding up or down.
@LarsWagner,Pro and pro max difference besides leger battery and screen size?!
@ajay08267,Same old upgrade nothing new
@dariusrat6468,"The camera control is a gimmick. Apple AI is the only real software improvement, which is just Apple playing catch up like always."
@AdamnW,"“It seems like the new features are tailored to industry professionals” Yes arun. They are, and it’s not really a secret either. The phones have been called PRO for a while now and definitely have been mentioning using them in PROfessional settings for some time. People want the latest and greatest of course but it’s often just to have those features to say you have it. Most people won’t use them, all of this includes myself being on the 14 Pro Max. But realistically if people want the casual phone it’s the 1x and 1x Plus"
@rizzzz1015,So apple got away with another year with ₹900 60hz phone
@ghos90396,So...the new button is basically useless if I&#39;m left handed
@charlech,Why does desert titanium look pink lol
@SamRommer,"Agree, camera button looks useless."
@TipsterAbeam,Thanks for your dedication and efforts. Mostly enjoyed
@bishaldas4878,"Why people are hating the iphone 16, I understand not a huge technical step up, specially I was expecting more on the watches but still an upgraded phone with same pricing."
,Apple being Apple again. Squeezing the consumer to the maximum with the minimum.
@personalsigh,Didn&#39;t use the word &quot;Android&quot; once in this video. Apple dictat?
@smartpianoayush,Apple is going to remove all buttons and buttons in i phone 17 by saying what&#39;s the need of buttons or ports if you have a display . Just Apple Things
@rakidoodle,It should have been a 3min video
@boi-is-boi,man it would be way better if they use the camera control as a fingerprint sensor

@Kosicode,I feel disappointed as a pro apple user. nothing innovative
@user-rc2lc1xf3m,"Same Phone, Numbers Changed."
@mukzz3381,"Bro I’m a Apple fan but this was actually dog shit 😂, it’s great for people who have an iPhone older than 14, and when I say 14 I don’t mean the 14 pro max that’s still perfectly fine. But for anyone who had a 14 pro max or newer this was useless, I doubt anyone is going to use the camera button after the novelty of it wears off."
@Luckru,it’s the same thing dawg
@ImTheBeau,"its like apple just added 3 new colours, changed the camera shell a little bit then called it a new generation"
@romankhan2249,most useless phone ever
@kaushikgogoi9545,I can&#39;t understand they literally have the same exact style only the chip and other bunch of upgrades and people still falls for it. Daymn
@justronny20,"Something I&#39;ve noticed with MWTB and MKBHD (not sure about other reviewers) is that during Samsung/Google events, they release their videos concurrently with those events, but with Apple events, they don&#39;t, but rather watch and live tweet about that event. Is it because they&#39;re plainly disrespectful towards Androids or Apple has stricter rules regarding videos during their launch event?"
@FlickEzraArtsTV,Green Screen
@RadinBahman-ti2zm,So this is what I got from the video it&#39;s basically like the iPhone 15 pro Max all over again😂

@o1ecypher,why dont they make the side touch sesative letting you place the touch anywhere you want
@philippeert,The blue looks pretty good
@elitepro102,Where is that one guy who literally does the iPhone durability test? Because you can never trust Apple when they say their newest iPhone is the most durable.
@cityisbetter,He just celebrated overtaking apple and now apple is leading 😂
@drpuneetuyalimath5731,"They can install whole new button, yet they say it doesn&#39;t have room for 3.5mm audio jack..<br>This isn&#39;t innovation.<br>Didn&#39;t like anything in iPhone 16 series. None of those features are useful in daily life."
@ZaneGbotVR,Under 1 hour
@masterdinosawr,It should not be okay to expect no &quot;revolutionary upgrades for the base iPhone from now on&quot;. <br><br>These are very expensive devices with very outdated &quot;features&quot;. 60hz screens on a phone at that price in 2024 is crazy. <br><br>This shouldn&#39;t be okay. This should be ridiculed and shamed. A company as rich as apple should be doing better for its customers. They&#39;re just lucky that their customers are stupid for continuing to buy their products. <br><br>But as a reviewer you need to mock apple and stand up for these stupid consumers because this should be unacceptable.
@lottoman1,Why Would I buy an iphone except for the camera.. samsung is way better.

@sinned120,Love the videos and excited to see this years iPhone battery test
@enzotiomiko6181,"For the people who says iphone kept releasing the same phone every year. What do you expect the iphone to look like, a circle? Square? Triangle? A star shaped where you can throw the phone?. Like all phone has the same design, rectangular screens, camera at the back, small camera at the front, and multiple buttons as the sides. I dont hear people said “oH ApPLe reLeAsED tHe SamE MaCbooKs” like all laptop are the same and nobody complained.<br><br>i mean if youre buying an iphone every year of course there will be no significant change at all, even apple are not forcing you to buy the new iphone, thats just fomo and thats a you problem. Plus apple never claim any new features added as their own innovation."
@ArvindSingh-fk7dy,"It&#39;s all Business, you know all these Tech giants can wait for like 2-3 years and come out with gigantic upgrades which will feel like a next gen product while giving you the updates needed to stay on par with the world, but nope they&#39;ll have events every 6 months and keep fooling people"
@jewelsgleaming401,Apple had better fix their phones otherwise I&#39;ll stick to my 12 forever

@dompede9795,love all the hate comments😂 just say youre a brookie
@adityachampawat1414,The new camera features on the Pro seem worth the upgrade for the ones using older iPhones
@pathfinder101,Until you stop buying the latest iPhones like zombi see a smart brain on zombi narket 😂 there will not be a real change.
@alkhris,Thank you so much. I always love and appreciate the detail and dedication put into your videos! I was watching the keynote but the video was very long and I didn’t really notice too many differences compared to last year’s phones so I just watched your video and I think it summarizes it really well 😁
@KhanggDaAvgeek,litreally an iphone 11 ultra max
@threesixty6448,Why a capture button for things that can be easily done with touch? 😂

@merajulislamrahat2638,Junk phone 🤧
@joshuamartin5085,Why aren’t these companies improving the hardware on the front facing camera. I think we use that more than the rear since we are all social media narcissists
@aaliyahlafleur1070,I kept waiting on YouTube for this!!
@elsa_g,"I largly agree with you but I am CONSTANTLY wishing I could manually focus my iphone camera. Trying to get a picture of an animal through a chain link fence, or even sometimes through glass? No luck. Trying to get a closeup of a flower, especially of bees on flowers, the autofocus will not cooperate!! I tried downloading other camera apps specifically because of this but wasn&#39;t able to get them working the way I like. Sooooo happy to eventually have a way to control focus!"
@Maximusprime24,Same stuff different year
@taliwalling4465,apple needs to provide at least a 90hz screen for the base version. it is 2024 and with its price tag
@dylanlee5342,I think it be nice if the non pros atleast went to 90hz screens. That be good. Pros need better colors again but id just get the gold probably haha
@KalpitWankar,Imagine buying a 60hz phone in 2024 for $800.
@Doryan_GMD,Honestly the 16 isnt that big of an improvement if you really want a better iPhone then wait for the 17
@Sudhir-tg7mr,"Siri needs a dedicated app...files, chat history &amp; usage patterns (click) all mapped out; think Shortcuts app, only smarter."
@karsonchristensen8045,Serious concern.<br>ok so I have a new iPhone 15 pro. Do I not get the new visual intelligence feature because I don&#39;t have a dedicated button for it? Also I love the idea of a dedicated slide bar for vertical photographers. I love the fact that apple is very inclusive of everyone. but... I&#39;m left handed... think about it... I&#39;m left handed.

@zulhasrin7,the very most innovative design and feature with the iphone having 2 separate button. what an innovative design indeed!!!
@user-gg4li5pd8f,So realistically is it worth upgrading from a iPhone 15 pro max to the 16 pro max? - my friends uses her phone for work too - for marketing like TikTok insta - would it make masses of difference?! Genuine advice only lol she ain’t never moving from an IPhone just putting that out there.
@flyingspaghettimonster8912,I feel like the camera button will be a 1 year feature they wont add it to the next phone. this phone might be geared towards film production apple might sell quite a few towards that market... I&#39;d bet they keep it around on the website for awhile just towards the movie / film production

@milans3747,"OnePlus used to be a stable option for gaming earlier . Now it&#39;s so bad even for flagships. I have tried gaming on iPhone 15 pro , it destroys anything I have ever used for gaming . Constant frames and amazing battery life and most importantly no over heating ."

@Mikelaxo,"The camera button reminds me of the power button on the Galaxy s10e, which has other functionalities like a fingerprint reader and you can use it as a slider. That button has potential for many functionalities other than camera"
@sarathkumar4607,So still no fast charging?
@Mark-sz6mq,I will stick with my pixel 8 Pro until Google starts to design their own chips. Then I will upgrade.
@BastiOn_1337,Can u copy more from Android and Samsung ?<br>Apple: YES!

@donniethesportsguy893,Camera button. How’s this gunna work thru cases 😂
@GlowPikimin,Apple has 19.6M
@zulhasrin7,iPhone 16 with its glorious 60hz display. wooooww such an awesome upgrade indeed!!!
@VirtualUser25,How did Apple beat Arun again in Subscribers count?
@rohansquared,Finally something in the budget segment worth buying!
@savindurandesh,Is that worth to update from 15 to 16 ???
@hamidahmadzai6968,All the changes that they made in the new model are very incremental
@luigibeleno4767,This come with 120hz?
@STTEFFEN,Just simple don&#39;t buy iPhone 😅
@rashadavery7742,Imo we have reached the pinnacle of what smartphones can do with the current technology available because speaking about Apple specifically they haven’t really made any groundbreaking or revolutionary advances in the smartphone industry as of late. You’re just paying for the brand name atp. I have a 13 pro max and the upgrades in the 16 is really abysmal or nothing special if you ask me. Maybe I just matured enough to realize that as long as I can do my daily task and make calls all them fancy words they use to make it seem like this years phone is gonna be 1000x better than your current phone means nothing to me or I’m just uninterested. <br><br>Like I said we have reached the pinnacle of what we can do with smartphones that releasing a new phone every year isn’t a game Changer or have you itching to buy it like it use to be. Ig ill still with my 13 until it blows up
@souvikmondal1249,Apple 1.96 crore and mrwhostheboss 1.94 crore
@CarDataBaseYT,WTF is Apple doing with Watch Battery. 😢
@rohansquared,It was refreshing to get a video of this and as a bonus you are the first one in my feed. 😊

@HaVoCX64,"So I bought a mac mini m2 in 2023 and i am really happy with it, i dont game or anything, just for work and learning, and i own an iPad mini6 for my studies. Never had an iPhone, was always team android. Should i get this one? My phone is xiaomi 11t pro, it’s battery is not in a good shape i must say. What do you guys think?"
@YusufEbr,Same shit different day
@sogeman,Apple is all about giving you what you didn&#39;t ask for and ignore all user feedback on what they actually should add
@tammmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,“Here’s what i found on the web” <br>Perfect impression<br><br>I too am tired of this. Waiting to see this new feature on my 15 Pro!
@SethStar99,Um. Apple just passed you in subscribers again...
@rohansquared,So basically iPhone 15 in nutshell 😂
@jaidenballinger8000,Is it worth getting a 16 if I have an 11?

@masterdinosawr,Apple users/fans need to hold them accountable for the shit they put out. The exact same shit every time.
@rohansquared,WAIT it’s already out? NO WAY!
@OGkGamingKnight-sw9jd,Apple has more subscribers than you now
@paidimarryprithvirakshaksh8153,"60hz in 2024 😊. Millions will still buy them, which is why Apple will make fool out of their customer base."
@tada2655,These things are a joke
@ApkEmpire,Hopefully someone finds a way to use the camera button as a shoulder trigger in games.
@Roardny,I think the camera control button solely exists to encourage horizontal capture with the camera in this vertical capture prominent era to encourage the spatial capture feature use and then to boost vision pro sales 🧐
@rohannain3792,Hate apple
@mohammada4315,Love it or hate it but apple going the nokia and blackberry road I can see it
@ashishkumawat6110,It&#39;s literally &quot;cutting edge&quot;
@TechWreck12,Who else has been waiting all day for him to post about the 16s
@frankvuong1080,Just wait for iphone 17 refresh.....
@tvdigest5273,Apple is horrible at innovation. Hole displays are 6 year old technology and apple cant get rid of Dynamic Island. 60hz display in 2024 is a crime. No flip phones from apple while other companies like huawei are way ahead. I have iphone 15 plus and oneplus and besides camera apple is doing nothing innovative. Its the same shit every year.
@rohansquared,"I love the way apple bragged about how innovating a diagonal camera layout is, only to go back to a verticle camera layout 3 years later"
@treytuttle7717,The base 16 is STILL locked at 60hz?? You&#39;ve got to be joking...

@dannymartial7997,"This event was such a let-down. The number of things that ISN&#39;T coming out with the new phone is more than the things that ARE ready from day-1. Everything is either beta or &quot;coming next year&quot;, which isn&#39;t really a reliable statement given their history (RIP AirPower)"
@schizophrenic-dev,60Hz for new gen iPhone is just crazy. What are they even thinking?
@ruben619448,I’ve been hands on with the iPhone 15 pro max for about a year now. The 16 is the same thing.
@Violet-ui,60Hz?<br>YIKES
@d-csingh8344,2008 apple was innovated now apple just making copy from old models of Nokia Sony LG Samsung this is the innovative copy

@joshreyla7789,Thats why i opted to ip15 pro max.
@joelloyd5877,Is that the reason they made the phones bigger to fit all the buttons in.
@zand_c,The cameras look very weird
@adwinjisslin3414,"Still not a turning point to upgrade to base iPhone 16, I use iPhone SE 2, iPad Pro M2, and MacBook Air M2 still not find iPhone worth to upgrade my Motorola Edge 50 Pro have more features than my iPhone SE 2 compared to android iPhone is reliable and last 6 yrs + without much hiccups that why I prefer iPhone over android as primary device but an android is must backup phone due to slow charging of iPhone"

@jaydentieugamer6789,Ima just stick with my iPhone 15 plus not gonna get the iPhone 16 plus basically the same thing gonna wait for iPhone 25. lol 😅.
@2013TombRaider,"I was ready to upgrade to 16 from my 14 pro if they gave us promotion 120hz. Well my 14 pro still can go years easy. My only problem with it is 128gb, made big mistake getting 128 gigs. If next year apple gave us pro motion in regular iphones. I can get 512gb for under 1100 and drag that phone for 5-6 years easy with maybe one time battery replacement around third year."
@viramir9606,I will buy iPhone once they remove the fucking notch. Lack of design 😢
@dannymartial7997,"The camera button is such a big  gimmick. I&#39;d rather have a TouchID button on the side, like the iPad. This feature is about as gimmicky as the Pixel&#39;s squeeze feature"

@delainemoyo9226,Its a dog shit joke 😂😂😂😂
@Bright.piano12,“Big moment for the 7 people that own an Apple Vision Pro” 😂😂😂
@Sebelfisch,"It&#39;s frightening to see how dumb people have become these days... Since the iPhone 11 Pro max (s0 for 6 generations now) the phones look basically identical. The amount of real &quot;upgrades&quot; (the average consumer will even notice) since the 11 Pro Max is like one generation of an Xiaomi phone. The y are ripping people off for years now and almost nobody realizes it or cares about it. 2 weeks ago I compared my wife&#39;s 13 Pro Max to my 15 Pro max in terms of speed and camera performance and the differences are either so minor, that you don&#39;t have to care about them at all, or they&#39;re simply not there. So why even bothering to upgrade to the latest version each year?<br><br>I&#39;m so glad we ditched our iPhones once and for all and bought Xiaomi 14 Ultras.. IS it the better phone overall? probably not, but the camera setup alone is worth more, than everything Apple is offering with their eco system and software &quot;advantages&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;ve been an Apple fanboy for over 15 years now and I will still buy Macs, no doubt about that, but their phones are not interesting anymore. I mean it took them 5 generations of Pro models to finally &quot;upgrade the shitty ultrawide lens. WTF?"
@entertainmentwithindian69,They actually DEGRADED THE 16 PLUS battery to compete it with pro max
@npcimknot958,Watch haptic feedback touch come back too cause they have 0 ideas

@nikkimaraviglia,Actively avoiding ai features on all devices. Hate how much access they have to our information.
@GoogleAnonimus,"Hey, it seems like you’re feeling a bit frustrated. Maybe they didn’t meet your expectations? I personally prefer the two-bottom design, and I think the shortcut app is a great way to make the most of it. The action button is a really useful feature, and it means you don’t have to worry about the camera taking up bottom and having its own."

@mikehamilton7487,"Apple are Olympic champions at disappointing “updates”. But this takes the cake. From the samples I’ve seen so far, in terms of image quality, the iPhone 16 pro max’s cameras are actually worse than the Iphone 15 pro max. Especially in night mode. They have boosted the exposure, but the detail/mushiness is worse on the 16. No upgrade to the telephoto where every other manufacturer is in a race to improve in that area. I’ll be giving this one a miss. Which is a shame since I’m one of the few people in the world who actually like the iOs system better than android. I just wish they would get serious about upgrading their camera hardware. Not an incremental improvement, but a radical overhaul to bring it in line with the best from Oppo/Vivo/Xiaomi."

@Swipespeed,I’m so glad Siri is getting an upgrade! I’m tired of “I found this on the web” too!
@denishmaharjan2635,"And yeaaaa, one more reason not to upgrade ...guess ill wait"
@siddarthmeena1708,"Tht camera control is totally useless, instead of waiting for those &quot;does work with every single swipe&quot; gesture over the sensor anyone could control exposure, focus and zoom from touch screen itself... And in lesser time. Although u can say tht delay of a second doesn&#39;t matter so much, bro its photography and videography... U miss ur key shot in fraction of a second."
@valjericholozada5660,i don&#39;t know but i didn&#39;t feel the 16 series upgrade now.
@tobiasss1463,Hope they fixed the manufacturing part where they make sure every part is properly secured... apparently they skipped out on one because APPARENTLY a few cents to make sure this piece is properly stuck on there is too much for Apple... so if you drop the device it&#39;s gonna cost the customer A LOT of money (typical apple)
@ahmadnasir001,What About Iphone se 4??
@gamebegins2308,"Apple should use the &#39;S&#39; series name instead of calling it the iPhone 16 series. It should be named the iPhone 15S series for incremental upgrades. Next year, it could be iPhone 15S1, then the year after, iPhone 15S2, and so on. After significant innovation, say in 10 years, they could release the iPhone 16 series."

Honestly, these updates could&#39;ve just been rolled out with a software update instead of having to launch a whole new phone."

@luisgabrielbaldonado9076,Cant even use all those tools until the next iphone 😂
@simpleH.,"Yea, for Europe it’s literally nothing new other then spacial Video and the capture button."
@valentinbusuioc4054,"most objective view, as always. looking forward for the review! But I am all in for the camera features, I can finally drop my mirrorless for good :D"
@fadedchicken,Ultramarine color just in time for the astartes arrival

@mvp_gamingYT,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-hK56jc14&amp;t=446"">7:26</a> isn&#39;t it a Data Privacy breach? 🤨"
@aseem7w9,"Apple really going full on Android with this one. Whether its the new software features, the design or adding gimmicks that no one asked for."
@geetnandedkar8463,under 20mins
@Տhuttle,Yeah no I’m not getting this
@Thatfunnyguyonyoutube,"Apple person walked out during the release conference, walked up to where on a wall is written &quot;Apple 15&quot; crossed out the 5 and replaced it with a 6. That&#39;s it 😑"
@nayar1a,Everybody who buys these phones in the EU is just wasting money
@user-dp1uv7fj5p,Bro they look like my phone. Mine is a iPhone 12

@saiekrishna,"Apple seems to be stagnating, with no new innovations. The features in the iPhone 16 are nothing fresh, as they&#39;ve all been done before."
@InsighterofTech,The only thing I like is their improvements to battery life. 4 hours more is crazy boost.
@sidharthshivappa1359,"It&#39;s really silly and goes to show that apple has nothing to offer customers true value addition by showing their buttons stuff. Remember, it was apple who teased blackberry saying buttons on phone are archaic and it&#39;s touch screen generation is future. Just see what apple is trying to sell people now !!!! This clearly shows that they have nothing to offer anything called revolutionary other than fooling people and playing games like this. Really stupid phone."
@theanimeguy7141,Super underwhelming. Not that I expected it to be any better 😔
@maddy_boy7317,Samsung S24 ultra had scratchs at level 7 with deeper groves at level 8 let&#39;s see what Apple is up to

@HolyLevite,I am one of those 2% of iPhone users that are absolutely hyped about the new capacitive button! I love that Apple is trying to turn the smartphone into pretty much a smartcamera lol.
@XROCHY10,I can&#39;t believe how much apple changed the phone.<br>I looks completely different (definitely)
@Prfssr_Brnstrm,Props to the editor(s)
@mon_66,There&#39;s literally 0 upgrades especially in the 15 pro and max. Literally there&#39;s no upgrade a sane human would spend money on.
@gzxchris5607,I knew he was going to upload any second
@Wsup_ivi,Am I the only one who didn&#39;t know about this event?
@Ankur71284,2024 and still 60 HERTZ on  $900 phone .. I’m debating right now  should I just buy s24 ultra right or buy iPhone  . Ultra currently is less then pro max online ..
@joyghosh7239,I prefer my s24 ultra
@nicholasdaniels1280,That&#39;s why I&#39;ll stick to my Android and use Gemini AI assistant and my Google Lens thank you for the information
@LookToTheNorth,"its like apple just added 3 new colors, and changed the camera shell a little bit, then called it a new generation"

@2008animemyworld,I watched the event live it was great
@anonymous-vh7ur,"The old iPhone camera layout was very good looking, i dont think Apple has made a good decision in making the camera layout of this shape. It feels more generic"
@J0RAmusic-1,Wow but how did you get it?
@shan.5525,basically nothing new
@slimiii,In my country it was 06:20 AM when he uploaded this.
@LookToTheNorth,"Apple: lets use the old camera design again and call it a day.<br><br>&quot;But sir, that can&#39;t be it. There needs to be more&quot;.<br><br>Apple: &quot;ugh, sure. Let&#39;s add another camera button&quot;"

@psk.n,lots of weird takes
@josephbeckmas9733,Seen a few first hand look for iPhones but your videos are always better scripted kudos Aaron
@LookToTheNorth,"Honestly, I really like how they actually decided to give the iPhone 16 not only a new feature that wasn&#39;t from last year&#39;s Pro phone, but also a new chip, giving the iPhone 16 Pro, the Pro version of said chip."
@RinzyVGC,"Is it using A18 bionic chip , if yes then that&#39;s the only upgrade i can see"
@c0denum3erOO7,Sony phones had that shutter button for years tho

@MilesHobbins-yt8fk,Great video! You help all of us by making these!
@theologicalissuesandpreach6662,iPhone since iPhone 11 onwards never has a major change.
@Aezoh,are the 16 pro&#39;s still 60hz???
@DanceLingo,Isn&#39;t iPhone using Google AI chips? So is it still Hi Siri or Hi Google? 🤣
@Steve_Green_777,6.9 inches? That&#39;s huge!
@InspirationtoGaming,They look so much better on web than in hand

@Rahulsharma-en5wk,Thanks bro🥳 for such an informative video.. absolutely love you are able to provide information crystal clear in such a short span of time. Kudos to you🥳
@MrHalloweenPlays,Touch id in capture button is a missed opportunity
@Themegalegendo,iPhone 16 not having ProMotion is the biggest missed opportunity
@WindyvibeswithMe,"Dude stop with the expressions, just be happy"
@_iamkar_,iOS18 is my most anticipated feature 🔥👏
@ItsMicless,now I’m just waiting for all the YouTubers to destroy them 😂

@legendryscorpion5962,They will give another button on another year
@ItsMicless,Why can’t they make the base models 120 hz when they’re charging like 1200 bucks for it
@sivanvarnakulasingam6679,"Arun, I&#39;m so sorry. Apple overtook you in subscribers... you&#39;ll catch Apple again soon!"
@axionx5460,The most &#39;Yeah! Whatever...&#39; series of phones Apple have ever released.
@WilliamPetersen01,"Yawn, Apple just slapped on new colors with the iPhone 16. To the average iPhone user, all they will see is &quot;New colors&quot;... Ooohhh look, Pink."
@DrCalvinTeach,I’m surprised at how much of Apple’s keynote was less about the iPhone 16 / 16 Pro but was about Apple Intelligence. They are really pushing that hard but most of those features won’t be out until iOS 18.4…NEXT YEAR.
@vijayajay1639,I have a 15 pro max should I upgrade to 16 pro max @Mrwhosetheboss
@RogueSenpai,"Yup, iphone20 would surround the phone with buttons"
@KAVINABHILASH,Meh
@Zest_37,Im early lol

@mysterycubix6471,"camera control, another place to touch by aaccident"

@epik7768,It&#39;s ugly 😭😭
@pancho3411,is it worth it
@DembegBoodes,"i was disappointed mrwhosetheboss didn&#39;t make a video on it, and boom, i am now happy"
@RadarPaudel,I don’t get why the older phone doesn’t come with Apple intelligence because even the mid range android phone come with all the AI features from that of the flagship android..
@FrostoOfficial,I was waiting for this video😅
@EverettSherwood,Arun you are the best🎉

@Henry-lc2pu,“Hey can I copy your homework” “yeah just change it up a bit” <b>adds camera ring and bigger screen</b>
@BLAKEEATS1988,"nothing really new except for that button. lol, I feel sorry for apple fans. others are having great screens with low pwms, 1 inch sensors etc. and you have this? a 60 hz phone in 2024, and a button? 😁 😂 if Im an apple fan, then I&#39;d be getting the 15 Promax which is on sale now. 😁 😂 or get something else that will blow your mind. 😁"

@LoganLe-tf1rm,I’m still on iPhone 7 Plus. I WON’T SWITCH!
@hazelnuts23,Apple Ecosystem is becoming more of a luxury now.
@shaney02007,"that camera button is a smart idea , but why not make all bttons on your phone like that so u can have ur volume buttons like that , like normal swipe it up or down for ur volume tap it and swipe for media volume , and double tap for like scrolling on a webpage , saves wear and tear on the screen ."

@ollyfenner,The camera button just seems like something that was on android years ago and a bit pointless

@apoorvadr,If only they could bring in high refresh rate screens in regular 16.. inspite of all those computation power it lacks what basic android phones are giving
@busyfoldingdishes,tim is cooked
@Aashish-Adhikari,❤❤❤
@user-pd6zn8xz5j,Gday gday
@CatsAreJustBetterInEveryWay,It out already
@sarvjot495,When the first impression is like 9th or 10th impression because the phone is pretty much the same...
@UnityGoogle,Nice
@micheleneanderson7739,you are the best
@OddyG59666,"same stuff. that new button on the side makes me not want to upgrade, its too much in the way and will be accidentely pressed way too easy"
@Friluftsliv99,A great video from a favorite tech YouTuber 👍👍👍

@gracehuff0928,Hi I love ur videos been watching them for 5 years now
@ALVI2963,"Finally, they changed the camera setup"
@The_Timer_Guy,"I love the way apple bragged about how innovating a diagonal camera layout is, only to go back to a verticle camera layout 3 years later"
@Myskei-44,Me ps5 pro +gta6 or iphone pro 🤔
@blxnk_alt,where&#39;s the strength test
@rinkatuki.,Need me a 16 pro max but i have to work years in country to buy one😭😂💔
@Memey12239,Bro is lucky to hold that in his hands ☠️
@realshri,Finally Arun dropped the vid!
@user-tx3sn8gk9j,1 year for a button. no foldables. doesn&#39;t android have a tri fold phone now? there is no new actual innovation here.<br><br>apple does not care about you.
@vivdamle,This camera button looks too much to the left.. needs to be more towards the edge
@BaNNDoG25,Haha apple is such a joke
@Datwopiece,اه<br>اها<br>\h
@dnls.lennart,"I just bought the new Moto G55, wich has OIS, 120hz, 30W charging, 256GB as standard and 4 years of updates for 249. 249..."
@gavinelesban,"They removed the audio jack to make the phone look more modern, yet they add these new buttons every year!"
@UnknownAintDead,The 16 Plus and 16 pro max has a 2 inch difference. Thats not very nice of u Apple
@zenvio,its the same damn thing. except for the cameras
@tushar_mk9,Still this iphone can&#39;t beat Arun&#39;s big iphone ultra pro Max 😂❤❤❤❤❤
@techandy1747,Its funny how Apple spend alot of time on AI but nobody says anything about it but when other companies do people complain😬
@shaon880,Like me if u like iphone but can&#39;t buy😢😂
@Funky_junkyard,"Fun fact: If it weren’t for the “s” iPhones, we would’ve been at the iPhone 19 by now"

@kridayrajpoot6686,what&#39;s new this year??<br>-colour.
@chetnabhardwaj9104,Damn
@Dusti_buns,"Apple: &quot;let&#39;s use the old camera design again and call it a day&quot;<br><br>&quot;But sir, that can&#39;t be it. There needs to be more&quot;<br><br>Apple: &quot;ugh, sure. Let&#39;s add another camera button then&quot;"
@just_mdd4,There will always be those who will defend 60hz on a $900 phone! 😝💯
@xxxtenatcionq,Bro already have a iPhone 16  💀
@deanwassink1088,Wonder if the iPhone 22 will finally have something worth getting excited about.
@cataldoareno909,2k views in 1 minute bro fell off 😭

@Catto-f1d,Early

@RandomThings650,iPhone 16
@ZacharySebree,Bro what I’ve never seen an ad for this 💀💀
@safwanfahmi8684,First Impression : A little upgrade
@ray3din620,hiii
@kinqpl3b,Still doesn&#39;t have 4 lenses?
@OwenHenry-ff5fz,Bro I went on your channel today and I didn&#39;t see this video but I&#39;m happy I wasn&#39;t sleeping to witness your review here.... Thanks bro 🎉
@Akif-Faisal,im really mad that the camera is removed to improve the handling and grip😢
@TimberWulfIsHere,Didn&#39;t the 15 just come out
@Nesor123,Wsp boys
@oseidwomoh,I love these simple videos.
@PyroTechnic-69420,Nah samsung about to have a field day when the iphone 16 is same as iphone 15 but still selling better
@shayaankalamalla,bro Apple ran out of ideas fr if thats the new phone
@aaronthepianoman8297,bruh who needs a phone
@IceSlimed,I’m getting a 16 base bc for once the base is actually pretty good
@COLLINS22689,Nothing changed
@AarushNishikanth1,Within 1 minute ganggg less go Arun my fav yiutuber
@user-tb2dt6io6e,love from Bangladesh
@tthegoodguitaristt,the new buttons awesome
@smileorange8465,Copy &amp;Paste again from apple
@NJMazani,"Unfortunately at nice as these software features (which will be on the 15 series pro phones anyway) and the minor camera features, its not compelling as a consumer whos looking for an upgrade unless you are a film maker which is a small percent of the consumer market. Samsung has just been given free ammunition for the S25 Note release in Q1 2025"
@just_mdd4,💡 Here is your reminder that you do not need to upgrade every year. Upgrading is worth it if you have an iPhone 12 or earlier.
@loki_76,No 120hz on the 16 is criminal.
@TimTamPlayz21,It&#39;s already out???
@AznRealization,Does that new color almost look pink to anyone else?
@hash6344,Passing 16 pro<br>15 pro is seems to be pretty comfortable
@MrNightraider,I’ll wait for the 18……. 🥱
@jackpot900,Cool
@justalexlol_,"Aaaand who would&#39;ve guessed, it&#39;s quite literally nothing new."
@warrensebastian01,I have been waiting 😅
@mohammadmehrab7224,something like Northing camera!
@COLLINS22689,What it out
@TwoSided2,"Honestly, I really like how they actually decided to give the iPhone 16 not only a new feature that wasn&#39;t from last year&#39;s Pro phone, but also a new chip, giving the iPhone 16 Pro, the Pro version of said chip."
@usernamenikolas,Apple finally changed it back to putting the new gen chip to the base model iphone.🎉🎉
@designwithsd,iPhones are getting better every time.
@sbarros944,I was waiting for your video
@mariusbucsanu6629,Yo
@thebastionsportGV,"Alright, I am going to throw out my iPhone 15 to get this."
